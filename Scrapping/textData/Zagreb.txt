Zagreb is Croatia's capital city. It lies inland, which means that unlike other capital cities in the region, it is outranked by coastal cities such as Dubrovnik in its popularity with travelers. However, Zagreb should not be overlooked as a travel destination; its lively urban energy is reflected in all aspects of its culture and can be easily accessed by visitors.
Though a fully modern city, Zagreb does have historic areas of interest that are integral to the life of the inhabitants. A handful of sights are listed below, but Zagreb has many more important attractions!
When you're touring the city, don't forget about Zagreb's museums, which cover aspects of Croatian life and local and international art.
Zagreb's restaurant scene ranges from fast-food vendors to upscale establishments. When you're in Zagreb, be sure to taste traditional Croatian cuisine, which is flavorful and hearty. The slow-food movement is popular in this country, which means you have the opportunity to enjoy a long pre-dinner drink while your entree is carefully prepared by chefs who present diners with food that never sees the inside of a microwave or the underside of a heat lamp.
Try Kerempuh, just above Dolac Market, for well-cooked traditional meals and pleasant service.
Zagreb's hotel scene provides anything from hostels to upscale, smack-in-center establishments. If your main focus in Zagreb is the sights, try to get a room close to the main square; there's plenty to do, eat, and buy there, too.
International and domestic flights to Zagreb arrive at the Zagreb Airport.
Zagreb is pretty well connected to other capital cities in Europe by both train and bus. It's also possible to visit other Croatian cities by bus or train.
Most sights in Zagreb can be easily accessed on foot, but if you require public transportation, consider the city's tram service. Tram tickets can be purchased at news kiosks and must be validated for each ride.
