Bayeux is a lovely, sleepy, medieval city. It might be most famous for the Bayeux Tapestry, which should be a not-to-be-missed attraction on every list, but it has plenty of other sites. The medieval center is delightful with bridges, small streets and a gently revolving water wheel and the glorious cathedral dominates the town, famous for its connections with William the Conqueror. But Bayeux had strategic importance in World War II and there's plenty here for enthusiasts, from the Battle of Normandy Museum and its diorama of the Falaise pocket, to General Eisenhower's statue and the largest British War Cemetery of World War II. 
In 2016, France and the UK celebrate the 950th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings where William the Conqueror beat the English in 1066.
The world-famous  Bayeux Tapestry is the reason why most people come to Bayeux. The tapestry tells the story of William the Conqueror in 1066 as he conquered the English troops at the battle of Hastings. The tapestry depicts the preparations for battle, the soldiers, the people and the animals. It is a real window into life in the Middle Ages. On the UNESCO Memory of the World Register, the Bayeux Tapestry is one of the world’s greatest treasures. It surprises and astonishes and never fails to impress. You should take a couple of hours to see the tapestry then explore the story further in the delightful museum.

More on William the Conqueror
Like Honfleur, Bayeux has a wonderful old historic center best known for housing the Bayeux Tapestry. This is the cradle of the Dukes of Normandy and its story is tied up with the Battle of Hastings in 1066. In the small heart of the town, you’ll find Notre-Dame Cathedral, buildings that once belonged to the bishops of Bayeux and the church, as well as streets of timber-framed houses. The houses are distinctive with towers adorning old manor houses and impressive large facades that proclaimed the importance of the long-gone owner.
There’s an excellent well-signposted Town Trail of 1.5 miles (2.5 kilometers) taking you past 21 points of interest, the major buildings and sights. You can pick up the Town Trail at the  Tourist Office.
The cathedral of Notre-Dame in Bayeux is an impressive building, a mix of Romanesque in the 11th century crypt and glorious Gothic in the 13th-century nave. In the 11th century after the Conquest of England by Duke William of Normandy in 1066, ties with England were strong. You'll see a reference to the turbulent past above the south transept portal where sculpted scenes show the life of Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who was assassinated in Canterbury Cathedral on the orders of King Henry II of England.
The Bayeux Tapestry was kept here from the 11th to the 18th centuries, probably displayed for the first time on the day the cathedral was consecrated in 1077 in the presence of William the Conqueror.
It’s well worth strolling around, and don’t miss the 15th-century frescoes in the crypt and the late 12th-century chapter house with its glazed and decorated bricks and tiles.

Bayeux in World War II was the gateway to the Normandy landing beaches, close to Arromanches. The great hero of the Normandy Landings, General Eisenhower, is commemorated in Bayeux in a statue on the Eisenhower Roundabout. He had become Supreme commander of the Allied Europe Forces in 1943, given the enormous, but ultimately successful task of managing the Normandy Landings.
In the Gold beach sector in Normandy, Bayeux was the main objective of the British troops on June 6th, 1944. Patrols were sent to Bayeux via the north eastern suburbs. British troops entered Bayeux, handed out cigarettes and promised to return the next day. When they did, Bayeux and Saint-Vigor-le-Grand were liberated without fighting. Bayeux suffered no damage and became the first French town to be liberated in World War II. 7 days later, on June 14th, General de Gaulle made his first speech on liberated French soil.
Many people going to the World War II Normandy landing beaches at Arromanches miss the Battle of Normandy Memorial Museum (Musée-Mémorial de la Bataille de Normandie) which is well worth a visit. It covers the strategic position of the Allies before the Landings and then moves onto the story of the battle from June 7th to August 29th, 1944, through maps, photographs and models, heavy equipment, arms and uniforms.
There’s a diorama of the closing of the Falaise Pocket which recreates Chambois village. Here part of the 90th US Infantry Division joined forces with the 1st Polish Armored Division on August 19th. Five themed areas cover the role of General de Gaulle from 1935 to 1946; the Mulberry harbors; Cherbourg; the role of the airforce in the battle, and the Battle of the Hedgerows. There are also various tanks outside incuding a Sherman M4 American tank and a British Churchill tank; and plaques and monuments just nearby.
The museum also houses some of the artefacts retracing General de Gaulle’s life through the events associated with Bayeux and the leader of the Free French during World War II.
