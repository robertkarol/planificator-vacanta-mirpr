Puerta del Sol (or Sol as it is commonly called) is as central as you can get in Madrid. It is actually seen as the center of the whole of Spain, as all road distances are measured from this point.
Just south of Gran Via. The streets of Montera, Preciados and Carmen all meet at Sol.
Nearest Metro Station: Metro Sol

Puerta del Sol is mainly used as a reference point for finding your bearings, but there a couple of things worth checking out while you're here. One is the Kilometer 0 stone, outside the government building. Another sight is the famous Bear and Strawberry Tree statue, a popular meeting point for tourists and locals alike. (Note, the statue has moved and is no longer where it is in this photo).
For decades there was an advertisement for Tio Pepe sherry up high above one of the buildings. This was removed for a couple of years but returned in 2013.
What is Gran Via?
Gran Via is the commercial center of Madrid, with big branches of Spain's most famous clothes shops all along it.
A little to the north of Sol. It joins Plaza de España with Plaza Cibeles (where the famous post office is).
Nearest Metro Station: Metro Plaza España, Metro Callao and Metro Gran Via.

There is more to Gran Via than just shopping. Architecturally, Gran Via is one of Madrid's most interesting streets. Though much of what see at street level has been drained of character by rampant commercialization, look up and see how the architects had intended Gran Via to look.
What is Cocido Madrileño?
Cocido Madrileño is Madrid's most famous dish. A stew featuring various meats, pototoes, chickpeas and other vegetables, Cocido Madrileño is served as two dishes - as a soup followed by the main dish.
Various restaurants may serve Cocido Madrileño as part of their daily menu del dia, but the one place I know of where you can guarantee that you'll get a cheap version of the meal is at Restaurante Doña Juana, on Calle Postigo de San Martín, just 30 seconds' walk from Gran Via.
Nearest Metro Station: Metro Callao

What is Convento de las Descalzas?
Former royal residence and now a convent and museum. Among the exhibits are pieces of wood that are said to be from Christ's crucifix, as well as a number of famous paintings. The cloister is also worth seeing.
The Convento de las Descalzas is on Plaza Encarnación 1, very close to Sol and Callao.

Opening times vary greatly. Closed Mondays and Friday afternoons.
What is Casa Labra?
A small tapas bar that is over 100 years old. Get your thimble-sized beer or vermouth and then go over to the tapas counter - the specialty here is cod. Try the cod croquettes or go for (my favorite) the cod nuggets.
Thirty seconds' walk from Puerta del Sol, on c/Tetuán.

Things to Do in Madrid: Sol & Gran Via
Madrid is the central capital of Spain and has many historic and cultural aspects to it, from the European art to its many museums. Popular artworks from Spanish artists like Goya and Velazquez are located in the city at the Prado Museum. For travelers on a time crunch, Madrid's number one must-see sight is The Golden Triangle of Art Museums. This includes the aforementioned Museo del Prado, the Reina Sofia, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza.
For travelers considering planning a trip to Spain, Barcelona shouldn't be the only city on the list. Madrid can be explored in just five-days with this suggested itinerary, and hotels and other accommodations are readily available in the city. When planning a trip to Spain's cities, such as Madrid and Barcelona, visitors can combine their itineraries with these guided tours and must-see attractions.
Travelers with a flexible time frame may want to consider staying a few months to learn the Spanish language. Travelers can also take a walk through Madrid's architecture, from classic Spanish homes to famous landmarks like the Teatro Royal. The food is inspired by various regions throughout the country, where travelers can enjoy local pleasantries like sopa de ajo, potato omelets, and of course, homemade sangria.
Planning an extended stay or an array of activities is a great reason for travelers to get a discount card. The Madrid Card is a great value card to consider for free entry into museums, guided tours, and other leisure activities. While visiting Madrid can get expensive, it is also possible to travel there on a budget by engaging in free things to do, as well as trying out cheap restaurants. Some specific ways to save money include staying in hostels, having coffee and pastry for breakfast, and exploring free walking tours around the city.
Sol is Madrid's most famous plaza and Gran Via is its most famous street. The two are tourist magnets that travelers may be tempted to hurry away from, but there are some little secrets worth checking out, as listed below.
 Paula Galindo / TripSavvy
This is Madrid's oldest district and likely to be one of the main focal points of one's trip to the capital. Check out these places:

La Latina is famous for tapas and its Sunday morning market, but there's much more to the district than just these things. See where to go:
These are the trendy districts to the north of Gran Via. Malasaña is the bohemian district, Chueca is nominally gay, and both are a lot of fun. Here's where to visit:
This is another old district of Madrid. Huertas has some of the best (and worst) bars in Madrid. Ernest Hemmingway also used to frequent this part of town. See where to go:
Paseo del Prado is one of Madrid's most majestic boulevards, with some of the city's most important museums close at hand. Madrid's famous park, El Retiro, is also near here. Museums and parks to visit:
One of the poorer districts of Madrid, Lavapies' mix of immigrants and trendy youngsters make this part of town one of the most diverse places to be. See what to do here:
Madrid's other famous park, Casa de Campo, is a bit further away than El Retiro but offers a number of worthwhile attractions. Here's what to explore:
This is Madrid's most chic district, with a few good museums around, too. Here's where to go:
Away from Madrid's most touristy districts, there are still plenty of things to do. Explore outside of Madrid:

Madrid and Barcelona are Spain's premier cities, and you could easily spend a couple of weeks in each, especially if you were to add in day trips.
But few people have so long for their vacation, so you'll have to plan well to get the most into your limited time.
If you want to do your entire itinerary by train, take a look at the rail map of Spain which will give you prices and travel times for your trip.
Obviously, which city you can get a cheap flight to will probably dictate where you start, but, if you have a choice, go to Madrid. The capital takes a little longer to appreciate, so base yourself there and give it a bit more time.
Valencia is not what some people would call an 'essential' stop for your trip to Spain. It is a great weekend break in its own right: as the home of paella, it is a fantastic city to eat in, it has great beaches, and its old town feels a lot smaller than it is. But if you are visiting Madrid and Barcelona on one trip, you are probably a big city kinda person; Valencia will pale in comparison to the other two. On the other hand, if you're trying to break up your Madrid-Barcelona vacation with a smaller stop along the way, the country's third biggest city doesn't really fit that bill.
However, Valencia is worth a visit, particularly for the paella. As part of a Madrid and Barcelona trip, you could spend half a day there or, at most, stay the night and leave after breakfast.
Usually guided tours tend to merely depart from one city and guide you in the other.
If you would like a tour of both cities, consider booking a walking tour in the city where you start.
You can't spend much time in each city with such a short visit, so you'll need to stay in one city and do a day trip to the other.
Explore Madrid with a combination of guided tours and exploring by yourself.
Morning: Do a Madrid Walking Tour or take the Madrid Hop-On-Hop-Off Sightseeing Bus for an overview of the city.
Lunch Visit El Botin, the oldest continually functioning restaurant in the world and Hemingway's favorite.
Afternoon: Check out Madrid's Golden Triangle of Art Museum. Pick the one that most suits you.
Alternatively, take a half-day tour. You can still fit in a walking tour of Madrid or a visit to one of the big museums.
Evening: Tapas, perhaps? Either by exploring the area just south of Sol or on a Madrid Tapas Tour. Or perhaps see a flamenco show at one of several good flamenco tablaos in Madrid.
Morning: The high-speed AVE train from Madrid to Barcelona means that, yes, you can do a day trip to Barcelona. There are guided tours designed especially for this, but you can do the trip by yourself too.
Afternoon: The Barcelona hop-on-hop-off sightseeing bus will fulfill all of your transport needs for the day. It will take you up to Parc Guell and the Sagrada Familia, as well as into the downtown Gothic Quarter, Ramblas, and El Born areas.
Evening: Return to Madrid.
Though both Madrid and Barcelona warrant more than a day, a suggestion for your third day would be to go on a day trip from the capital, or even a half-day trip, and spend the rest of your day in Madrid.
For the options below, you'll want to stay in Barcelona and flip the itinerary around, visiting Madrid as a day trip, or going through the hassle of checking into hotels in both Madrid and Barcelona.
If you don't want to leave the city but want an experience that is different from the typical hustle of central Barcelona, head up to to Gracia, the village-like district on the other side of the Eixample area. There are also plenty of excellent Day Trips From Barcelona, with two trips that stick out as being particularly worth considering. These are in fact both half-day trips, which means you can spend the other half of the day checking out the city.
A Visit to Montserrat fantastical rock formations and a famous monastery await you after some gorgeous views on the rack railway and cable car. Visit by yourself or on a half-day tour, but we recommend combining it with a stop at the Gaudi Crypt and Colonia Guell.
The Dali Museum in Figueres: Salvador Dali is one of the world's most fun artists in the world, and that is well represented in his Disney-like museum, just a short ride by high-speed rail from Barcelona. Visit by yourself in a half day trip, or combine it with a visit to Girona with this Dali Museum and Girona Guided Tour.
You could also use your extra day to visit Valencia en route between the two larger cities. Either check your luggage at the train station and spend just the day in Valencia, or stay the night and leave in the morning. At the bottom of the page there is more on visiting Valencia.
Four days gives you long enough to split your time evenly between the two cities, meaning you don't need to choose between the options in the 2- and 3-day itineraries—you can do them all! Bear in mind, though, that 4 days is still not really enough time.
Where to Stay: Find a hotel in Madrid close to the train station for the first night, and transfer to Barcelona on the evening of the second night.
For more details on the individual parts of this itinerary, see above.
Day 1: Explore Madrid.
Day 2: Visit Toledo or El Escorial and the Valley of the Fallen in the morning and see more of Madrid in the afternoon. Transfer to Barcelona.
Day 3: Explore Barcelona.
Day 4: Visit the Dali museum in Figueres, or go to Montserrat Montserrat.
Alternatively, take a 4-Day Guided Tour of Barcelona and Valencia from Madrid, but bear in mind that there are no days in Madrid on this tour, so you'll need extra time to explore the capital by yourself.
A 6-day itinerary allows you to conveniently divide your trip into 3 days in each city. If you can only spare 5 days, then drop the extra day from either Madrid or Barcelona.
Most of this suggested itinerary is similar to the 4-day version, with 2 extra days.  This gives you the option of either spending more time in one of the two cities or adding in an extra stop between the two.
Alternatively, day 3 or 6 could be spent in Valencia.
For the days outside of Madrid, consider a 4-Day Guided Tour of Barcelona and Valencia from Madrid.
Suggestions for this day include:
Madrid and Valencia are connected by the high-speed AVE railway. The whole journey takes just over 90 minutes (sometimes a bit longer) and costs around 45€. But consider adding in Cuenca on the way (see below). 
How to Get to Valencia From Barcelona
The train route between Barcelona and Valencia isn't as quick as the Madrid-Valencia route, with journeys taking over three hours, sometimes a lot more.  
Stay the Night or Visit en Route? With 4.5 hours of train travel ahead of you, it might be tempting to stay the night in Valencia. However, it's preferable to travel from Valencia to Barcelona in the evening—say from 6pm until 9pm—and then get a late dinner in Barcelona, rather than waste your morning in transit.
What to Do in Valencia
Paella! The famous rice dish is at its best in Valencia. If you thought paella was a seafood dish, you'll be pleased to know paella valenciana is actually made with meat (while vegetarians will easily find a version for them too).
The old town area has a great small-town feel to it (but you'll get that in spades if you visit Gracia in Barcelona). 
There is also the Ciudad de Artes y Ciencias—a huge modern art and science exhibition complex—and the beach.
Consider these options if you do not want Valencia as your third stop:
San Sebastian or Bilbao: The Basque Country is an excellent place to visit. San Sebastian is renowned for its tapas (known locally as pintxos) while Bilbao is home to the Guggenheim museum. But, if you're already trying to cram big cities like Barcelona and Madrid into a short tour, adding one of these two is probably biting off more than you can chew. Choose somewhere smaller.
Logroño: This city has all of the gourmet food of San Sebastian, but it's cheaper and closer to Madrid and Barcelona. This would be my choice.
Seville: You can take the high-speed train down to Seville from Madrid and then fly to Barcelona. But again, this is a big city—do you really want to be adding it to an already hectic itinerary?
Zaragoza: This convenient stop is on the same train line as Madrid and Barcelona, but there's little to see apart from its two cathedrals.
Cuenca and Valencia: Visit Cuenca's stunning ravine and hanging houses en route from Madrid to Valencia; round off your day with paella near your hotel in Valencia; and head off to Barcelona the next day: Cuenca and Valencian paella is better than just Valencia.

Stay in Madrid: You'll find it a little more convenient as there are more hotels near Atocha, the main station. This will help minimize travel time for getting to Barcelona. It is also very close to Madrid's main art museums and is a short walk from Sol, the center of Madrid.  
Visit Barcelona as a Day Trip: Yes, it's possible, thanks to the AVE high-speed train. See Guided Tour of Barcelona From Madrid.
Take Tours: It's the only way to get much out of such big cities in such a short period of time.
Visit El Escorial and the Valley of the Fallen, two sights that offer a stark reminder and both the glory (the former) and the horror (the latter) of Spain's past.
The city of Toledo is just 30 minutes away by high-speed AVE train, giving you enough time to explore by yourself or on a Half-Day Tour of Toledo From Madrid.
A Half-Day Tour: The aforementioned Half-Day Guided Tour of Toledo or El Escorial and the Valley of the Fallen fit the bill here.
Full-Day Tour From Madrid: If there's nothing left in Madrid for you, you could do a Day Trip to Segovia and Avila.
An Extra Day in Madrid: Visit the Royal Palace or explore the La Latina and Lavapies quarters.
Day 1: Explore Madrid. Visit El Prado 
Day 2: Visit Toledo or El Escorial and the Valley of the Fallen in the morning and see more of Madrid in the afternoon. Transfer to Barcelona.
Day 3: Extra day in Madrid. 
Day 4: Explore Barcelona.
Day 5: Visit the Dali museum in Figueres, or go to Montserrat.
Day 6: Extra day in Barcelona
Explore Lavapies: Cheap rents here have brought artists and immigrants into the same barrio, giving you a fantastic mix of ethnic stores and fashionable stores. You have the Reina Sofia here as well as a cat cafe!
Go for breakfast, or a late night snack, at the Chocolateria de San Gines.
Visit the Retiro park.
Get a classic calamare baguette at El Brillante.
Visit Montjuic: The hill that overlooks Barcelona, home to the Catalan National Art Museum and the Olympic Stadium. 
Visit Tibidabo: The other hill you can see from Barcelona.

As Spain's two premier cities, you can't go wrong whichever you choose. But if you had to ​select one, which should it be: Madrid or Barcelona?
Of course, you should visit both. And with the high-speed AVE train now serving the route between Madrid and Barcelona, the journey is quicker and easier than ever.
But if you do have to choose, here's a breakdown of the pros and cons of each city.
Lonely Planet/Getty Images
Barcelona is a much more touristy city than Madrid. And tourists bring prices up. It's not that Barcelona doesn't have cheap things to do, it's just that there are much more of them in Madrid.
In Madrid, you can get cod tapas thirty seconds from Sol (Madrid's main square) at Casa Labra for a euro or a great meal for 10 euros just off Gran Via (Madrid's main street) at Con Dos Fogones. The equivalent restaurants in Barcelona are too busy doing paella and sangria 'deals' to offer real value for money.
Meanwhile, Madrid's two best museums (the Reina Sofia and the Prado) have a free entry every night of the week, something you'd never see in Barcelona.
Winner: Madrid

Heard of Toledo and Segovia? They're both near Madrid. The satellite cities around Madrid are some of Spain's most interesting and diverse. Barcelona also has some good day trips, including Figueres (for the Dali museum) and Sitges (for the beach), but Madrid's day trips are unbeatable.
When it comes to exploring the rest of Spain, Madrid's central location makes it far superior to the north-western Barcelona. The AVE train can get you to many Spanish cities incredibly quickly, while normal trains and buses will get you everywhere else.
Winner: Madrid

Architecture is the main reason tourists visit Barcelona. Most of Gaudi's madcap modernist buildings are in Barcelona and it is in these designs that the city's reputation is hinged. Madrid has some attractive buildings, especially along Gran Via, but it can't compete with Barcelona.
Winner: Barcelona

Catalan cuisine is well respected throughout Spain. Not far from the touristy areas of Barcelona you'll find some great food, but it takes more effort than in Madrid, and you'll always end up paying more. A good tour company, such as Food Lovers Company, can ensure you're not disappointed.
Eating out in Madrid is less difficult. The restaurant scene in the capital takes in all the regions of Spain and countries of the world and it isn't spoiled by the kind of tourist-focussed eateries that plague Barcelona.
Winner: Madrid

Though both cities have an abundance of language schools, language exchange evenings, and people looking to meet and practice their language skills, the important thing to remember is that the main language in Barcelona is Catalan, not (Castilian) Spanish.
For this reason, alone, Madrid wins.

Madrid has three of Spain's most famous art museums: the Prado (which ranks up there with the Louvre for pre-20th century art), the modern art of the Reina Sofia (featuring Picasso's masterpiece, the Guernica), and the Thyssen-Bornemisza, said to be one of the best private art collections in the world.
Barcelona is not short of art museums, with the Picasso museum being the most famous, Madrid is a clear winner here.

Barcelona has a beach, Madrid doesn't. Or at least not a real one. But in 2011, Madrid council unveiled Madrid Rio, a new complex by the Manzanares river publicized as having its own beach, but it doesn't really - just a place to sunbathe (the Retiro Park as just as good for this). But if you want a real beach, you need a coast, something Barcelona has. However, Barcelona's beach is horrible and should be avoided. Luckily, there are plenty of beaches nearby (such as in Sitges) to make Barcelona a good destination for catching some rays.
Winner: Barcelona

It would be difficult to argue anything other than Barcelona for this one. Barcelona's proximity to the Mediterranean gives it slightly cooler summers than Madrid, but milder winters and springs. Madrid has great springs and falls, but winter and summer can be a little on the extreme side.
Winner: Barcelona

Both cities have packed event calendars.
Barcelona has both the Primavera Sound and Sonar music festivals, as well as the neighborhood celebrations of Gracia and Merce. Meanwhile, Madrid's gay district, Chueca, gives Spain one of its most flamboyant carnival seasons (not to mention Gay Pride).
Winner: Barcelona

Kids are well looked after in both Madrid and Barcelona. There are some good science museums in both cities. Kids will appreciate the modern art of Picasso and Dali (perhaps more than most adults), and there's plenty of them in both cities. But it is Barcelona's modernist art that, like with their parents, will capture the children's imagination the most.
Winner: Barcelona

Two of the best nightclubs are in Barcelona (Sidecar and Razzmatazz). However, while Barcelona has some great individual bars and clubs, Madrid has whole streets of cool nightspots. Whatever your age or taste in music, Madrid will have somewhere for you.

Madrid's appeal is a little more subtle; it takes much longer to get a real feel for the capital than for Barcelona. You could find several reasons for this - the architecture of Barcelona is an obvious point in its favor, as is its setting between the mountains of Montjuic and Tibidabo and its more obvious 'center'. If you only had a weekend in Spain, you'd feel like you 'got' Barcelona much faster than you would Madrid.
On the other hand, the longer you stay in Madrid, the more you'll appreciate it.
Winner: Barcelona

Gaudi has a lot to answer for. Through his weird and wacky architecture, Barcelona has become the city that captures the imagination of most visitors to Spain. If you have only a brief time in the city, you cannot fail to be impressed by Barcelona.
But take a little more time and Madrid's charms become apparent. Cheaper, with more variety, better food, and generally more to do than Barcelona, Madrid gets the top prize for a longer trip.
If you're in the south of France and want a quick weekend in Spain and to experience Gaudi's architecture, Barcelona is the one for you. But if you have a week to spare to explore a bit more and you like art, go to Madrid.

No matter how much time you spend in Madrid, you'll never be bored. With world-class museums, grandiose architecture, and diverse dining scene, it's full of places to be and things to do. 
At the same time, this wealth of attractions and activities comes with Spain's famously laid-back lifestyle, so there's no pressure to see or do it all at once. And if 18 things aren't enough, be sure to check out our master list of 100 things to do in Madrid for more ideas.

Any art aficionado visiting Madrid knows that the Reina Sofia Museum forms part of the prestigious Golden Triangle of Art. The massive complex houses one of the world's premier collections of art from the 20th century, including big names like Picasso (don't miss Guernica), Dalí, and Miró. Get your tickets on their website for a small discount.

Spain's nightlife is legendary, to say the least. The two big discotecas in Madrid are Kapital and Joy Eslava, but they're not the end-all-be-all of nightlife. The trendy Malasaña neighborhood is home to some great clubs that often give you more bang for your buck.
Michael Busselle/Getty Images
Madrid's central location combined with Spain's excellent intercity public transportation network make the capital an ideal home base for exploring the rest of Spain. Cultural Toledo, sunny Cordoba, medieval Ávila and more are all just a quick train ride away. Start planning your ideal day trip from Madrid and get ready for an adventure that you'll remember for years to come.

Every city in Spain has a main square that forms the centerpiece of daily life for both locals and visitors. Here in Madrid, that square is Plaza Mayor, one of the most ornate and grandiose examples of architecture in the city. The restaurant and cafes with terraces that spill out onto the square are on the touristy side, but their indisputable charm helps add to its appeal.

Even if you're not a soccer fan, you've likely heard of Real Madrid. As one of Spain's most legendary teams, it comes as no surprise that their home turf—Santiago Bernabéu Staidium—is one of the top things to see in Madrid.
If you're in town during soccer season, you absolutely can't miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to watch this iconic club take the field, but get your tickets ASAP. In the off season, it's still possible to experience the magic of Real Madrid by taking a tour of the stadium.

While it may seem like the center of life in Madrid is the area around Gran Vía and Puerta del Sol, you'll find that getting off the beaten path can give you a more authentic glimpse of life in the city. In this case, you don't even have to go very far. From the multicultural spirit of Lavapiés to the buzzing tapas joints in La Latina to the literary history that lines the streets of charming Huertas, there are whole worlds within reach of Madrid's central hub.

The heavenly combo of churros and chocolate is one of the most famous examples of Spanish cuisine many visitors may know, and for good reason. While locals often enjoy churros for breakfast, they also make a great mid-afternoon (merienda) or late-night snack.
When it comes to where to eat churros in Madrid, you're spoiled for choice. One of the most popular spots is Chocolatería San Ginés near Plaza Mayor, but its fame often brings long lines and big crowds. Head to Chocolat in Huertas for equally delicious churros in a more relaxed environment.

If the Reina Sofia is the foremost center of modern art in Madrid, then the Prado is the equivalent when it comes to the classics. Here, stunning masterpieces such as Las Meninas by Velázquez, Goya's Black Paintings, and an unmissable selection of works by El Greco are obvious standouts, but every single one of its 7000+ pieces is worth seeing. Get your tickets online before you go to avoid lines at the box office.
Madrid is one of Europe's greenest capitals, with dozens of gorgeous parks and gardens just waiting to be explored. If you only have time to visit one, though, make it Retiro. As the most famous of the city's green spaces, it boasts a picturesque manmade lake, a lovely rose garden, a glimmering crystal palace filled with artistic installations, and more.

Everyone thinks they know what tapas are (small plates from Spain!), and while that definition is generally true, tapas are so much more than just food. Here in Spain, they're a social experience and a way of life.
Tapas are all about getting together with good friends to share plates and conversation, often moving from bar to bar along the way. Check out a traditional joint like Casa Labra or La Casa del Abuelo, or go modern at a place like La Palma 60.

The Chamberí metro station no longer serves passengers, but remains frozen in time. After closing in the 1960s, it became abandoned for several decades until a restoration project brought it to new life. Today, it looks much the same as it did in the 1920s, with glamorous vintage advertisements and old-fashioned turnstiles. It's a fascinating way to experience a bit of the glamorous Madrid of the past, and best of all, it's free.

A real Ancient Egyptian temple in the heart of Spain's capital? Yes, you read that right. The Temple of Debod was moved brick by brick from Egypt to Madrid in the 1960s, and today stands as one of the city's most unique sights. Its location in Parque del Oeste is just down the street from the Royal Palace, and it provides one of the most stunning sunset views in Madrid.

Look down as you pass the old Royal Post Office in Puerta del Sol and you'll see an unassuming metallic plaque. This is Kilometer 0, which marks the geographic center of Spain and the point from which all major roads begin. As you stand in the heart of the country, look up at the clock on the post office building, too—it's said to be official source of time in mainland Spain.

Spain's royal family may not actually call the Royal Palace home, but their official residence is still worth a visit. Get your ticket online and show up to experience the marvelous opulence of this jaw-dropping 18th century building. Entry also includes a visit to the Royal Armory, an impressive collection of royal armor and weapons dating from the 13th century.

You don't need us to tell you that Madrid is one of Europe's trendiest fashion capitals. From the glitzy international designers in chic Salamanca to the funky boutiques in Chueca and even the big-name global brands on Gran Vía, you'll be able to find your perfect shopping district here in Madrid no matter what your heart desires. Bonus points if you come during the semi-annual sales period (rebajas).

Market halls are where madrileños do their grocery shopping, catch up with friends and neighbors, and even grab a bite or a drink at the market bar. These colorful centerpieces of daily life are a great way to live like a local while in Madrid. The Mercado de San Miguel is the city's most famous, but for a less touristy experience, consider Mercado de la Paz or Mercado de Antón Martín.

Madrid looks even better when seen from up above. Head up to the top of the Circulo de Bellas Artes building to access its iconic rooftop—you'll have to pay a small entrance fee, but it's well worth it for the awe-inspiring, sweeping views of central Madrid as well as the fabulous mixed drinks and good vibes.
Want to go all out when it comes to experiencing Madrid's dining scene? The world's oldest restaurant is calling your name. Botín has been going strong since 1725, was name-dropped by Ernest Hemingway, and serves the best roast suckling pig this side of Segovia. Just don't forget the wine.

As Spain's capital and most happening city, Madrid offers a bar scene that perfectly blends traditional Spanish heritage with sleek, contemporary vibes. From the no-frills neighborhood watering holes populated by Madrid's abuelos to chic, avant-garde locales that are redefining local nightlife, there's a bar here for everyone, no matter what vibe you're searching for on your night out. This roundup of the best bars in Madrid will help you start to narrow it down.

It can be hard to find a good place to eat near Puerta del Sol, Madrid's thriving central square that, unfortunately, is surrounded mainly by chain eateries and tourist traps. One exception is La Casa del Abuelo, which has been serving good, honest, homemade Spanish food since 1906.
On any given night, you'll find this traditional spot packed to the rafters with madrileños who come from all corners of the city to enjoy the tapas they know and love in a bar that has withstood the test of time.
What to Order: Gambas al ajillo—sizzling hot shrimp served in a garlic butter sauce with just a hint of spice—is now one of the most popular tapas in Spain, but La Casa del Abuelo claims to have invented this humble dish all the way back in 1939. Pair it with a glass of wine from the owners' very own vineyards.

Tapas bars in Madrid's buzzing Malasaña district are a dime a dozen, but among those dozens, La Palma 60 is a force to be reckoned with. With a sleek, minimalistic interior and a menu full of unique bites you won't find anywhere else, this spot perfectly blends the tapas tradition with modern haute cuisine.
After hours, it doubles as one of the most popular jazz clubs in Madrid, with smooth sounds from the live performances lasting late into the Spanish night.
What to Order: Their white truffle risotto is a dream come true.

The craft beer revolution has taken Europe by storm, and Madrid is no exception. Whereas not too long ago your only options on tap at any given bar were Mahou or San Miguel, the Spanish capital now boasts a thriving craft beer scene thanks in part to Fábrica de Maravillas.
As the city's premier microbrewery, they serve a variety of American and Belgian-inspired artisanal brews, all produced onsite. One sip and you'll immediately see how this place more than lives up to its name (which translates to "Factory of Wonders").
What to Order: You can't go wrong with anything you get here, but their IPA is one of their most talked-about brews for good reason.

In recent years, Spanish wine has started to rightfully earn recognition as some of the best in the world. And when it comes to sipping on rich red crianzas, you can't get much better than Stop Madrid. With their original shop having held down the fort on Calle Hortaleza since 1929 and a handful of other establishments scattered throughout the city, this is the place to enjoy Spanish wine and charcuterie in a place that hasn't changed much in nearly a century—wood paneling, oak barrels, dusty bottles and all.
What to Order: Keep it classic and go with a glass of Rioja and a plate of Spain's culinary pride and joy: acorn-fed Iberian ham.

Part speakeasy-inspired cocktail bar, part wine lover's dream come true, there are few places in Madrid that offer as sleek a gastronomic experience as Angelita. With more than 50 wines available by the glass and 10 times that many by the bottle, it's a verifiable vino heaven—and we haven't even gotten to their fabulous food yet. The menu changes daily to reflect the use of only the finest market-fresh products available, but no matter what you order, you can rest assured that it'll pair fabulously with what you came here for in the first place—a glass of wine.
What to Order: Angelita has become the talk of the town as much for their wines as for their expertly curated artisanal cheese boards. Pair your selection with a glass of rich, robust Spanish red, such as Toro.

Ready to let loose and dance? Marula Cafe is calling your name. Nearly every night of the week, this lively bar in La Latina plays host to DJs and artists representing just about every genre you can think of—soul, funk, blues, electronic, and more. They're also one of the only bars in Madrid hosting regular hip-hop jam sessions (every Thursday night).
What to Order: Settle in with an expertly mixed cocktail as you enjoy the show.

Flamenco—good flamenco—can be hard to come by in Madrid. Too many places lean towards the touristy side, with subpar performances and more out-of-towners than locals. Not Tablao La Quimera. The place is small enough that the performers don't even need microphones or amps, giving the whole experience a more intimate vibe that massive concert halls just can't offer.
Yes, there will be the occasional tourist, but when madrileños themselves go to a flamenco spot—as is the case here—you know it's the real deal. And perhaps most importantly, the performers here are some of the best in Madrid, capturing the heart and soul of flamenco with every clap, stomp, and twirl.
What to Order: Sip on something Spanish as you enjoy the show, such as tinto de verano (a refreshing local alternative to sangria).

Vermouth isn't your grandfather's drink anymore, and Casa Labra isn't your grandfather's bar. Okay, so a good part of its clientele may be made up of old men who have been going there for decades, but for every Spanish abuelo propping up the bar, you'll find a group of young madrileños enjoying drinks and tapas out on the terrace. Their house vermouth is among Madrid's best, and living proof as to why this dark, slightly sweet white wine is enjoying a resurgence in popularity among Spain's youth.
What to Order: We've got three words for you: salt cod croquettes. In addition to their famous vermouth, you can't miss these crunchy-creamy bites that helped put Casa Labra on the map.

Blending Latin American and Japanese elements, Sakale offers one of Madrid's most unique dining options for those looking for something beyond typical tapas. The fun, colorful space in Malasaña is the perfect spot to start any night out on the town, and the tasty fusion bites are unlike anything you've ever tried before. Come for the sushi and tacos, stay for the good vibes and friendly atmosphere.
What to Order: This place serves up some of the best sushi in Madrid. Try it with a Latin-inspired cocktail such as a margarita to maximize the fusion experience.

Despite its unassuming exterior, 1862 Dry Bar will whisk you back to the glamorous Madrid of the past from the second you step through the historic doors. With its high ceilings and chic, sophisticated decor, it looks like something out of a Fitzgerald novel—and the cocktails themselves are second to none. Staffed by a friendly, knowledgable bar team that can mix up any concoction you throw at them, this is the place to sip in style in the Spanish capital.
What to Order: Try their famous mint julep.

No experience feels quite as simple yet as luxurious as the simple act of sipping a drink with Gran Vía at your feet, and that's exactly what's on offer at the Círculo de Bellas Artes rooftop bar right in the heart of downtown Madrid. With an entrance fee of 4 euros, and drink prices on the high side as well, this experience is not the cheapest, but if you have room in your budget it's well worth it for the great vibes and breathtaking views.
What to Order: Go with a classic Spanish gin tonic.

Sadly, every year it gets harder and harder to find bars in Madrid that have withstood the tests of time and gentrification. La Venencia, fortunately, is one of the locales that has managed to hold on. A no-frills Spanish pub where (according to legend) Hemingway himself once drank, they serve just five drinks—all sherry wines from select bodegas in southern Spain. It still looks much the same as it did when it opened at the turn of the century, which is reason enough for visiting.
What to Order: Manzanilla sherry, the driest wine in the world, is crisp, refreshing, and will transport you to southern Spain in one sip. For something a bit milder, go with a nutty amber oloroso.

Many visitors come to Spain in search of two things: sunshine and sangria. The former is plentiful; the latter...not so much. Good, authentic sangria can be hard to come by in Spain. While it does originally hail from the Iberian Peninsula, it's not really something most Spaniards drink, and has earned a reputation as an overpriced drink for tourists.
But if you absolutely can't leave Madrid without trying a glass, you're in luck—you can find decent sangria here if you look hard enough. With a gorgeous outdoor terrace and friendly, welcoming ambiance, Saporem serves up some of the best (and most authentic) sangria in Madrid. This is one of the few spots where you'll actually see locals ordering a pitcher to share.
What to Order: Their cava and strawberry sangria is a delicious twist on the classic wine cocktail.

Few Madrid experiences are as enjoyable and authentic as spending a morning at the local market. These buzzing food halls are where madrileños do their daily grocery shopping, and it's not uncommon to see them stopping for a bite with friends at one of the market bars, either.
Every Madrid market will have a bar, but one of the best is Casa Dani, which calls Mercado de la Paz home. They serve up plenty of tasty Spanish dishes, but the standout is easily their famous tortilla de patatas. The trip up to the market in the posh Salamanca district is worth it for this iconic omelet alone.
What to Order: The famous tortilla, of course—if you're feeling adventurous, try it with salsa de callos, a tripe sauce. Wash everything down with an ice cold beer.

Many locals claim that their only complaint about Madrid is that there's no beach. Those in the know, however, make their way to Ojalá, a bright and colorful little spot that's turned its entire downstairs area into a makeshift beach—sand, beach bar, and all. If that's not reason enough to go, they also serve one of the best and most delicious brunch offers in Madrid.
What to Order: A beachy cocktail is in order at a place like this.
  Best Traditional Tapas Bar: La Casa del Abuelo  
  Best Modern Tapas Bar: La Palma 60  
  Best Craft Beer Bar: Fábrica de Maravillas  
  Best Traditional Wine Bar: Stop Madrid

The Spanish rail network is efficient and well connected, at least from Madrid. However, it can occasionally be a bit expensive compared to the bus and it isn't always quicker. Read more about Bus vs Train Travel in Spain.
Madrid's two main train stations, Atocha and Chamartín, are linked by the Cercanías local train service. Some routes go right through Madrid and visit both stations. There are two stops on the Cercanías line between Atocha and Chamartín at Nuevos Ministerios (which is also a major Metro interchange) and at Recoletos on Paseo de la Castellana (nearest Metro is Chueca).

Below are the most common destinations for traveling from Madrid with the train station you'll need, good for 2014/2015. Read more about Madrid's train and bus stations below this table.
Atocha train station, more formally known as Puerta de Atocha. Close to the city center, Atocha has many of the city's most famous sights within a five-minute walk (see below).
At the end of c/Atocha and Paseo del Prado, about twenty minutes' walk from Sol.Address: Glorieta Carlos V s/n, tel: +34 902 24 02 02.Metro Station: Atocha Renfe on L1. Read more about the Madrid Metro
Atocha is well connected to Madrid's bus station, airport, and other train stations, and is within walking distance of central Madrid. Read more here: How to Get to Atocha Train Station
Atocha serves most routes to the south and east of Spain. See the above table for the most popular routes in Spain. 
At Atocha train station itself, there is a little tropical garden, complete with terrapins, in the main forecourt (see picture above), as well as the Memorial to Madrid Bombings of 2003.
Across the road from Atocha there is the Reina Sofia Art Museum, home to the Guernica, Picasso's most famous work. You can check your luggage here, so even if you're just transferring from the airport to the train station, a quick trip here is a great way to break up all that traveling. There is also El Brillante, where you can get the finest calamari baguette in the whole of Madrid. A few minutes further away is the Prado museum, Spain's most famous classical art museum.
The easiest way to get from Atocha station to Chamartin is to take the Cercanias local rail service. Chamartin is three stops from Atocha and the journey takes just 10 minutes. The cost of a ticket is about 1.50 euros.
If you have some time to kill between trains, you may want to explore the city center first. In which case, you'll want to take to take the metro instead.
If you're arriving in Madrid at the main airport (Barajas), you have a few options for getting to Atocha.
Sol is the central point in Spain (in fact, it's the center of the whole of Spain).
Madrid's main bus station, technically called Estacion Sur is located quite close to Atocha train station, but you are most likely to want to take the train to get between the two.
Spain has an extensive bus service run by a number of companies from various bus terminals, which makes booking your ticket quite difficult. Tickets can be booked from the stations, but it is often easier to use the Movelia online reservation service.
Madrid's main bus station is Méndez Alvaro. Avenida de America is also important for some northern routes. There are a couple of other bus stations but these are mainly for local routes.
The main Conde de Casal Bus Station, which ran the Auto Res bus company's national routes, closed on September 18 2007. All Auto Res buses that used to leave from Conde de Casal now leave from Estación del Sur on Mendez Alvaro (see above). However, the 'inter-urban' routes (to the suburbs and small towns outside of Madrid) still run from Avenida del Mediterraneo, near Conde de Casal. This includes buses to Chinchon.

Metro/Cercanias Take the metro one stop to Airport Terminal 4 and then take the Cercanias (local train service) to Atocha.  These two train services require two different tickets. It is around the same price as the bus, and as the walk in the airport to the metro is quite long, it may be no quicker than the above bus-and-walk option. Alternatively, take the metro to Nuevos Ministerios and change to the Cercanias there.
Walk You can walk from Sol to Atocha in around 20 minutes. Walk down Calle Carretas, cross Plaza Benavente and turn left down Calle Atocha.
Metro/Cercanias Take either line 1 of the metro or the Cercanias to Atocha. It takes around five minutes.

 Madrid, the capital of Spain, is a bustling metropolis with well over three million residents. Visitors who travel here enjoy manicured boulevards, world-famous European art museums, sporting events and a warm Mediterranean climate. And, of course, there is plenty to do — and eat — here for families. In fact, you'll likely see children running around all over the city, at all hours, especially in the summer months.
Read our list below for the best things to do with kids in this beautiful city.

This 350-acre park, in the heart of the city, has it all—manicured gardens, boating, a stunning crystal palace, sculptures (see if the kids can find the sculpture of the fallen angel), running paths, art exhibits and live music. This is the place to relax after a morning of sightseeing and walking all over the city. Pack a picnic and enjoy a restful afternoon. The people-watching at Buen Retiro Park is great too. You'll really get a sense of the easy-breezy lifestyle of Madrid.

Plaza Mayor, or "Main Square" was once the center of Old Madrid, where people convened for socializing, bull fights, and even executions. Today, this popular Instagram-worthy colorful square, with cobblestones at the center, is at the heart of all things charming — boutique shopping, coffee shops, street vendors restaurants, and independent artists. Visit just as the sun begins to set and watch the natural light dance over the buildings.
You may not have been previously aware, but Madrid is home to some serious Go-Kart racers. The Carlos Sainz Go-Kart Center is the largest track in all of Europe, satiating kids' need for speed. Experts are on-hand to show drivers techniques and offer skill training sessions. There's also a huge indoor playground for little kids that aren't ready to get behind the wheel.
Tablao Las Carboneras 
Madrid is a wonderful place to see authentic Flamenco dancers, singers and guitar players. No two dancers or performances are alike — improvisation is the name of the game. Visit Tablao Las Carboneras on Conde de Miranda Street, on the bottom floor of the palace of the Count of Miranda. All your senses will be engaged as you watch, listen, and dine at this one-of-a-kind traditional show.

Positioned along the banks of Manzanares River, Madrid Rio is the perfect place for peace and relaxation. Rent bikes and ride around the grounds, breathing fresh air and seeing the sites as you go. There are historical bridges as well as cool new modern bridges — it's interesting to see the mash-up of the two styles. Kids will love any one of the 17 play spaces along the way — some even have zip lines and climbing walls. Skateboarders will love the skate park. Of course, there are lots of places to snack and dine to get your fill.

Visit the most famous open-air flea market in Madrid, held every Sunday as well as on public holidays yearlong: El Rastro. You can find the most magical oddities here — art, second-hand goodies, clothing, antiques, toys — and kids will love exploring the various vendors. Afterward you can stop for ice cream or coffee —or a small glass of beer (called a caña) — in one of the many cafes that line the streets. The market is located along Plaza de Cascorro and Ribera de Curtidores, sandwiched between Calle Embajadores and the Ronda de Toledo.

Of course, your family will need to eat—daily as it were—and so, a visit to San Miguel Market will fill your bellies. This is the place to go to try lots of new and exciting foods—walk around more than 30 stands, full of Spanish cuisine. You can order small portions for your picky eater—the risk is low if your kid doesn't like what's being offered. This covered market, built in the early 1900's, is as beautiful as it sounds. Sit and stay or order to-go—either way, you can be sure that you'll find something satiating here.
 Parque Warner
After traveling around Madrid, exploring its culture, museums and dining, your kids might want to take a break. Take them to one of Madrid's theme parks. Parque Warner Madrid, also known as Warner Brothers Park, is a great option with its 42 thrilling rides plus the Parque Warner Beach waterslide haven. Parque Warner, located southeast of the city of Madrid in San Martin de la Vega, is accessible by public transportation, making it easy to visit while on vacation without a car.
Other theme parks in Madrid worth a visit include Aquopolis Water Park and Zipline Adventure Park Madrid.
 Parque de Atracciones
There are two theme parks close to Madrid (one very close to Madrid): the Warner Brothers'-themed one in San Martín de la Vega and the imaginatively titled Parque de Atracciones. Both have the big scary rides for the bigger kids and areas aimed more at the young 'uns.
Parque de Atracciones is near the city center — it's just a ride on the Madrid Metro away. Kids can scream to their heart's content on loads of rides and rollercoasters, divided into five different thematic zones: La Gran Avenida, Tranquility Zone, Engineering Zone, Nature Zone and Nickelodeon Land.
Pro Tip: Book online for special savings and download the park's app to have maps and information accessible.

Kids love visiting animal parks and seeing wildlife and Madrid has a number of great places to visit. The Zoo Aquarium Madrid is a popular zoo and aquarium, situated on nearly 50 acres. This zoo and aquarium is one of the most-visited and largest zoos in Spain. Kids will love visiting the white tiger habitat, seeing the giant pandas nosh on bamboo sticks and watching the dolphins swim around. Families can view over 6,000 animals — 500 different species — while strolling the grounds.
The Faunia Ecological Park Madrid is another popular place to visit with kids in tow. This zoo and botanical garden, divided up by different ecosystems, experiences less tourists and is affordable for families.
Burrolandia is a cute little place to meet some donkeys. Located in Tres Cantos, kids can take part in Burrotherapy, which is a way for kids to interact with the donkeys, take part in their care and experience the benefits of nonverbal communication with animals.

Hot air balloons in Madrid are inexpensive compared to in other countries. The landscape around Madrid can be beautiful, but the most exciting part would be to fly around historic cities such as Segovia or Toledo. Kids will love seeing the city from above — way above — on this bucket list (see what we did there?) adventure.

Planes, trains, and automobiles fire up the imagination of most kids. Luckily, there's plenty of museums to appeal to little petrol-heads in the Spanish capital.
Museo del Aire offers viewings of miniature and full-size airplanes, Anden 0 lets families step back in time to see what a metro station looked like in the 1960s, Madrid Train Museum (Museo del Ferrocarril) is designed for children with a fascination with trains (that's all of them, isn't it?), Madrid's Naval Museum is a free museum for kids that like boats, the Fireman's Museum will teach kids about fire safety in a fun and engaging way and, finally, the Royal Automobile Foundation Museum (Museo de la fundación RACE) displays vintage cars at the old Jarama Formula One circuit. You'll find that these museums have quite a bit of history attached to them, which will enrich the experience as you learn more about Spain's role in past events.

Spanish modern art, including such luminaries as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali, is the kind of thing that anyone can enjoy. And with a variety of interesting and even bizarre works on display, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía really is a treat.
Children and families can take part in one of the program offerings at the museum to enhance their visit. Explore dance, visual arts, music and more in a hands-on environment, led by artists and museum educators.

Real Madrid, a professional Spanish football club, is Europe's most successful soccer team and always has a roster of some of the biggest footballers in the world. A match at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium will excite any child interested in football. Stadium tours, which last about two hours, are also available. Sports fanatics will definitely get their fill at Real Madrid.
Madrid Xanadu
Madrid Snow Zone is Madrid's only indoor ski slope, with 'real' snow. Kids can ski, snowboard, and play in the snow all day long. Families can also take a ride down the hill in a toboggan or try out a snow bike. Lessons are available for all skill levels and there are runs organized by varying difficulty levels: Green, Blue, Red Black.

Renting a boat in the grandiose lake that forms the centerpiece of Retiro Park will obviously cost you, but you don't need to pay a cent to enjoy the park itself.
Located just east of the city center at the end of Calle Alcalá, Madrid's most famous green space draws thousands of visitors each year for good reason. But don't let the number of people scare you off if you're looking to escape the crowds. The park is large enough that it doesn't feel too overwhelming, and you'll be able to enjoy a relaxing walk in relative peace.

Madrid is famous for its trio of museums known as the "Golden Triangle of Art": the Prado, the Reina Sofía, and the Thyssen-Bornemisza. While all three charge an entry fee most of the time, they each have special free hours throughout the week. Lines can be quite long, so be sure to show up early to get a spot at the front.
Additionally, several other Madrid museums offer free entry all the time. Check out our complete guide to free museums in Madrid and start planning your route.

Madrid—and Spain in general—is full of picturesque plazas. Luckily, both of Madrid's two most famous squares are easily within reach of each other.
First up is Puerta del Sol, home to the famous bear and tree statue as well as Kilometer 0, which marks the exact geographic center of Spain. If you're craving a sweet pick-me-up, swing by Pastelería La Mallorquina on the western edge of the square for one of their famous chocolate napolitanas. It's not free, but trust us—it's worth it.
As you eat your pastry, make your way down Calle Mayor to the second of Madrid's must-visit squares. Plaza Mayor is perhaps the most iconic symbol of Madrid there is. While it's more of a tourist hangout than a local space these days, the impressive design of the square will take your breath away.

The Chamberí station of the Madrid metro was inaugurated in 1919. For the next few decades, it remained a crucial stop on the city's original subway line.
Until it fell into gradual disuse, that is. The station was closed in the 1960s and remained abandoned for decades.
A restoration project in the 2000s transformed the station to its former glory. Today, it's open as a living reminder of what public transportation in Madrid was like in the 1920s. Also known as Andén Cero, the Chamberí station is free to visit and provides a fun, off-the-beaten-path alternative to the typical tourist sights.

Anyone who knows anything about Madrid's elegant Barrio Salamanca will tell you that it's the city's top shopping district. Indeed, most of the major fashion houses in the world have stores here, making it the undisputed king of style when it comes to Madrid barrios.
Obviously, buying something at one of these major fashion retailers is far from free. But window shopping here can be a fun way to spend an afternoon away from the crowds of central Madrid. The neighborhood is located north of the center and is mainly residential, so you'll be joined on your stroll by Spanish families enjoying the fabulous Madrid weather.

Yes, you read that right. A verifiable treasure of the ancient world can be found right here in Madrid.
The Temple of Debod was given to Spain as a gift from the Egyptian government in 1968. As a result, it was completely deconstructed, moved piece by piece to Madrid, and rebuilt. It's one of just four Ancient Egyptian temples in the world located outside its ancestral homeland, and it's absolutely free.
The temple is located about a 10-minute walk north of the Royal Palace. Come at sunset for an especially stunning view you'll remember for years to come.

Every Sunday morning, without fail, the Rastro flea market sets up shop in Madrid's La Latina district.
Calle de la Ribera de Curtidores and the surrounding streets become a massive open-air secondhand shop, with vendors selling all kinds of unique knickknacks and antiques. You don't even need to buy anything to enjoy your time here. Just spend an hour or two wandering among the stalls and checking out the bizarre finds—this place is proof that one man's trash is another man's treasure.

Just down the street, hundreds of eager visitors flock to the Círculo de Bellas Artes building and its famous rooftop terrace. The problem: it's crowded, and even just getting up to the top costs four euros (that's before you even buy one of the pricy drinks).
That's not the case at the El Corte Inglés department store in Plaza Callao. Head up to the ninth floor, where you'll find not only the massive Gourmet Experience—a foodie paradise unlike any other—but a terrace offering similar views over Gran Vía. You can certainly grab a bite to eat or a drink if you'd like, but access to the terrace itself is absolutely free.

Don't go too far after you've experienced that amazing view. You're right in the heart of Madrid's most happening street: Gran Vía itself.
It's busy, loud, and crowded, but a trip to Madrid wouldn't be complete without a stroll down its most central avenue. The architecture lining both sides of the street is breathtaking, and well worth braving the masses of people to marvel at.

Everyone loves Retiro, but let's head south of the city center for a moment. In the few years it's been open, Madrid Río has become the place to spend a casual Saturday afternoon among the local crowd. 
The park—named after the river it's built alongside—is impeccably designed, and provides plenty of fun for visitors of all ages. Part of it even becomes a "beach" in warmer months—a welcome solution to the only real complaint madrileños have about their inland city.
A onetime tobacco factory that's been converted into one of Madrid's coolest cultural spaces, La Tabacalera is a must-visit. This unique locale hosts everything from art exhibitions to live performances, and entrance is completely free.
You'll find this fascinating center in the Palos de la Frontera neighborhood, just north of Metro Embajadores.

The Palacio Real may be the official residence of Spain's royal family, but when it comes to official government matters, look to the Congreso de los Diputados.
Built in the mid-19th century and easily recognizable thanks to the famous lions that flank its front entrance, this distinguished building is proof that government headquarters don't have to be stuffy and stale.

For fewer crowds and great weather, the best time to visit Madrid is in the spring or fall. In addition to these perks, you'll also enjoy lower prices on accommodation during the low and shoulder seasons, making them budget-friendly options as well.
No matter what time of the year you decide to visit Madrid, you're sure to have an unforgettable experience. In this guide, we'll break down exactly what you can expect weather- and event-wise every month of the year, making your trip easier and more enjoyable all around.
Madrid's deceptively high altitude (650 meters above sea level) means that temperatures can vary quite a bit from season to season. By and large, you'll experience the best weather in the spring, when the average daytime temperature is in the low 60s Fahrenheit in March and April, and the high 60s by May. Spring (particularly April) is one of the rainiest times of year, but the typical drizzles and light showers are nothing a compact umbrella can't fix.
Fall is also quite pleasant, with temperatures remaining in the 60s Fahrenheit throughout September and October. Winter is chilly, with an average daytime temperature of 48 degrees F in December, but the plentiful Spanish sunshine makes it more bearable.
Summers are scorching in Madrid. June is relatively mild, with temperatures in the 80s F, but that can soar up past 90 and even 100 degrees in July and August.
As tourists pour into Madrid during July and August, locals flee the city and head for the shores. If you visit Madrid during the summer, keep in mind that lines at attractions such as the Royal Palace are likely to be long, and many local shops, restaurants and businesses — especially those that are family-owned — may close for a few weeks while their owners are on vacation.
More people means more money, which means that accommodation prices can soar in Madrid during the summer months. If budget is your biggest concern, visit during low season for better deals on lodging.
The first month of the year falls smack dab in the middle of low season in Madrid, and low crowds generally mean low prices on accommodation. Snow isn't common, but Madrid's high altitude will make it seem colder than it actually is with the wind chill. January also marks the start of the first of Madrid's two semi-annual sales periods (rebajas), making it prime shopping season.
Events to check out:
