The five-star Corinthia Hotel Lisbon is one of Lisbon's most enduringly popular luxury hotels. And it's not difficult to see why:•This is a no-question five-star hotel, with the handsome rooms and the refined, English-speaking hotel service that luxury travelers expect• It's a modern high-rise hotel that provides a respite from Lisbon's antique atmosphere• It is run by a family-owned, Malta-based hotel company, Corinthia Hotels, that is dedicated to excellence• The hotel's imposing 27-story height delivers stunning views of beautiful Lisbon• Guests can enjoy two restaurants, plus a club-level lounge, and one of Europe's best city spas• The property was recently awarded “Europe's Leading Green Hotel” and “Portugal's Leading Conference Hotel” at the 2015 World Travel Awards
The Corinthia Lisbon is situated in the Sete Rios neighborhood of Lisbon, and is not within the bustling city center. But in my opinion there's nowhere better to base yourself for a short stay in the Portuguese capital.
The hotel is near everything you'll be doing:• It's only a 10-minute ride from the international airport• And a quick subway ride from the historic district of Alfama and the nightlife hub of Bairro Alto (attraction-packed Belém is reachable via subway and then bus or tram)• Great news: Corinthia Lisbon is set by a main train station, so it's easy to hop aboard foward popular day-trip destinations• My day-trip choice: medieval Sintra, known for its stunning palace, castle, and university; hire a scooter (we used Magik Green) and motor out to the coast for amazing sights from Europe's westernmost point

Next: the view-tiful rooms and suites at Corinthia Lisbon
Corinthia Hotel Lisbon is a large, modern hotel. It offers 518 guest rooms and suites spread over 27 floors.
I stayed in an open-plan Executive Junior Suite on the 24th floor.

The best room in the house, as at many hotels, is the Presidential Suite. And this hotel's Presidential Suite is said to be the fanciest suite in Lisbon• It rambles over nearly 1700 square feet, the size of a three-bedroom city apartment• The suite features a large master bedroom with a king-size bed, second bedroom, spacious living and dining room, fully-equipped kitchen, library, and two bathrooms

Dinner is a la carte.• I wholeheartedly recommend starting with pan-fried foie gras marinated in white Port...• ...followed by either the ginger-flavored salted codfish with vegetables or the grilled medallions of veal in Madeira wine sauce alongside truffled scrambled eggs and potato• For dessert, try the dark chocolate pot de creme with olive oil and sea salt along with Burmester tawny Port• Típico's wine list is extensive, but for real local flavor order a Portuguese vinho verde ("green" wine, which is white)

While the population of Lisbon proper is a little over half a million people, the Lisbon Metropolitan Area is composed of 2.8 million people. Lisbon is a very walkable city.
Influenced by the Gulf stream, Lisbon has one of the mildest climates of western Europe. Winter and early spring offers the most rain, but it snows only infrequently in Lisbon and freezing temperatures are rarely felt. Mist off the Atlantic sometimes makes Lisbon feel cooler than inland Portugal. For Lisbon historic temperatures and rainfall, as well as current weather conditions, see  Lisbon, Portugal Weather.
Lisbon Portela Airport is located 7km north of the city of Lisbon. There are two taxi stands at the single airport terminal, outside Departures and Arrivals. The new extension of the Red line connects the international airport to the Lisbon metro system. See the metro map.
ScottUrb provides transport to the airport from the Estoril and Cascais area. Buses operate every day and leave every hour from ​07:00am to 10:30pm.
Lisbon has several railway stations: Santa Apolónia and the Gare do Oriente are the major ones. All offer access to the city center via public transport or are within walking distance. Santa Apolónia, the larger main station, has a tourist information office. Rossio station is located in the heart of Lisbon. [Map of stations]
There is a good tourism office located at the Arrivals hall of Lisbon Airport. If you don't have a hotel reservation when you arrive, this is the place to get your map and make lodging plans. Other offices are located at Apolónia rail station, Mosteiro Jerónimos in Belém. There is a kiosk n the heart of the city in old quarter of Baixa, that will answer all your questions as you walk around in this fascinating city. The main Lisboa Ask Me Centre is in the Placa do Comércio.
The Lisbon Tourism web site is Visit Lisboa.
Hotels in Lisbon cost less than in most other capitals of Western Europe. This makes Lisbon a great place to splurge on a level of luxury you can't normally afford. I've had great stays at the five star Dom Pedro and the Lapa Palace.
The Bairro Alto Hotel is a favorite with visiting Americans. Even if you're not staying there, its panoramic terrace is a fine place to have a drink in the afternoon or evening.
If you need an apartment in Lisbon, HomeAway lists almost 1000 vacation rentals in Lisbon district.
7 Colinas - one card gets you on pretty much every transport system in Lisbon. The rechargeable card has an antenna that you hold near a reader found on Carris buses and trams and at the underground to allow admittance. It's rechargeable, and a great value for transportation in Lisbon.
The new Navegante Pass offers full mobility throughout the city of Lisbon by integrating the public transport companies Carris, Metro and CP in the city's urban circuits.
One of the most compelling day trips from Lisbon is to Sintra, a 45 minute train ride away and a world apart, full of (real) fantasy castles and villas.
While the trip to Sintra is very easy to do on its own, you might want to consider a Viator day trip from Lisbon tour (book direct).
The seven hills of Lisbon are loaded with things to do.
The alfama district near the Targus has escaped many of the earthquakes that have ravaged Lisbon, and you can walk through the narrow lanes and enjoy the old village atmosphere of Lisbon. Nearby is the Fado Museum, a must for music lovers.
Santa Maria Maior de Lisboa or Sé de Lisboa is Lisbon's cathedral and the oldest church in the city. It's been rebuilt many times after various earthquakes, and has a jumble of architectural styles. Construction started on it in 1147.
Get great views of Lisbon from the Castle of São Jorge on the city's highest hill.
Take the #15 tram from Comercio square out to the Belem district, where you'll likely spend all day seeing the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos (see Mosteiro dos Jeronimos pictures), visiting the Belem Tower (Belem pictures), or Terre de Belem, and the Padrao dos Descobrimentos (discoveries monument), with time out for a Pasteis de Belem, the famous custard tarts of Lisbon. Have lunch at A Comenda Restaurant inside the Belem Cultural Center.
If you have time left over, take the #28 bus from in front of the Monastery to Postela and visit the Parque das Macoes, built for Expo98, and see the Oceanarium, one of the biggest aquarium displays in Europe.
For shopping and nightlife, the Bairro Alto is the place to be. Nearby is the Elevador de Santa Justa or Santa Justa lift, where you can not only see Lisbon from above and visit the Convento do Carmo, an earthquake-ruined Carmelite Convent that stands as a sort of symbol of Lisbon, but you can buy transportation tickets good for all forms of public transport at the base of the Elevador, including the 7 Colinas pass mentioned above.
Estação do Oriente, Orient Station, besides being a major transportation hub, is a beautiful iron and glass structure particularly evocative at night.
We've enjoyed the Restaurante A Charcutaria, which specializes in the food of the Alentejo region of Portugal. A hot, new restaurant offers up some fine, up and coming wines from Portugal, Enoteca de Belém.

Lisbon is well situated roughly in the middle of the Portuguese coast and, with good train and bus connections, is a good place to base yourself for exploring central Portugal.
Let's take a look at some of the most popular day trips from Lisbon.
The place everyone most wants to visit from Lisbon is perhaps the most awkward, due to the two-and-a-half-hour train ride, but connections to Porto are easy so it is quite doable.
A more realistic day trip (or trips) is the sights to the west of Lisbon, especially Sintra. Transport connections are good between all of these sights, so you can easily combine two or even three in a day.
Evora is a world heritage site, with Roman ruins and a chilling bone chapel (Capela dos Ossos). And, as it is situated in the Alentejo wine region, there are also some great wineries to visit too. 
Both train and bus take around 90 minutes to get to Evora from Lisbon.
Fatima is an important Catholic pilgrimage site due to reports of the apparition of the Virgin Mary back in 1917. The main attraction is the Sanctuary of Fatima, which commemorates the reported event.
Fatima is often combined with a tour of some other religious sights in the area.
The university town of Coimbra has a wonderfully idiosyncratic student tradition (take a walking tour to learn about it). It takes just an hour and a half to get to Coimbra by train from Lisbon.
Fatima and Coimbra are in the same direction, but as there is no train station, you'd need to travel by bus to include Fatima
You'd be ill-advised to visit both Fatima and Coimbra in a day. but if you are traveling light, Fatima could be a convenient stepping stone to Coimbra, with the logical next step being onward to Porto. Suddenly, there's an itinerary emerging!
Some of the best sights outside Lisbon are so close to the capital and to each other that they can be visited all in a single day.
All buses are operated by Scotturb, while train info is available at  Cp.pt.​
Sintra is, for a many, a day trip in itself. But if you tend to tire easily and would prefer to combine your trip with a few hours at the beach, you can easily combine it with some time in Cascais or Estoril. Alternatively, an excursion to Cabo da Roca is a good way to break up your day.
If you're on a beach vacation, you'll probably choose Estoril or Cascais as your base and perhaps head over to the other for a change of scene (or to check out Cascais' more extensive nightlife), which is easy by bus, taxi or (during daylight hours) walking.
But three or four in a day? There is little point in packing two beach towns into such a long day, so drop Estoril. But even then, you'll be hard-pressed to make such a trip by yourself. 
How to Travel Between Sintra, Cascais, and Cabo da Roca
The 403 bus here is your friend. It departs hourly, going from Sintra to Cascais via Cabo da Roca and takes around an hour. If you're in a hurry, the 417 bus misses out the cape but gets you between Sintra and Cascais in half the time.
Estoril and Cascais are just five minutes apart by train (you can even walk). To get from Estoril to Sintra, take the 418 bus.
On this page, you'll find transport information for getting from Lisbon to Fatima, Obidos, and Nazare by guided tour, bus, train, and car.
The bus takes one hour from Lisboa-Campo Grande. Check schedules at Rodotejo. 
The bus from Lisbon to Fatima takes 1h30 and costs about 10€ each way. Book from Rede Expressos . 
The closest train station is 10 km outside the town and requires a bus transfer.
There are regular buses by Rede Expressos to Nazare from Lisbon, taking around two hours.
Bus connections are poor or impossible between these sights, so your only option is a guided tour or driving.
Guided Tour: There are many guided tours from Lisbon to Fatima. Some take you directly to Fatima or you can combine other sites with Fatima.
By Car: It takes around an hour to get from Lisbon to Obidos. The onward trip to Fatima - via Nazare - takes a little over an hour. The return journey to Lisbon then takes around an hour and a half. Better still, finish your day in Coimbra, a 50-minute drive from Fatima.
Looking to visit Portugal's Alentejo wine region? Then you'll most likely want to head to Evora, the capital. 
Though Evora is a little further from Lisbon than most Day Trips from the Portuguese capital, it is still well connected by both bus and train, making it a popular destination for sampling Portugal's under-appreciated wines.
If you are coming into Portugal from Spain, you may prefer to stop in Evora before making your way to Lisbon. It takes just over an hour from Badajoz or two hours from Merida. Note that Portugal is in a different time zone to Spain, which may mess with some booking websites' travel time estimates.
See also:
The bus and train take a similar amount of time and cost about the same. The train will be more comfortable, but if you are staying close to the bus station, it may be more convenient to just take the bus. 
Bear in mind that if you want to visit a winery, it will be much easier to go by guided tour.
There are guided tours from Lisbon to Evora. The tour should include a visit to the chilling Chapel of Bones in the St. Francis Church, as well as sights such as the Cathedral of Évora, the Roman Temple, and the Almendres Cromlech.. 
If you are staying in Evora for a few days, you may prefer to do a tour that begins in the city.
The train ride from Lisbon to Evora takes 1h30 and costs about 15€ one way.
The bus from Lisbon to Evora takes a bit over 1h30 and costs about 20€ round trip (or around 10€ one way). Book from Rede Expressos.
The 130 km drive from Lisbon to Evora takes about one-and-a-half hours.

The city of Lisbon offers a wide array of fun activities and great tourist attractions during the daylight hours. But when the sun goes down, the city really shines with a fabulously varied and robust nightlife scene. There’s much to choose from in the evening, as Lisbon is home to many cool bars, clubs, live music venues, and restaurants. So, if you’re into checking out the local culture, the Portuguese capital doesn’t disappoint. When visiting Lisbon, be sure to enjoy a few exciting nighttime activities in the city: 
Lisbon boasts a cool and entertaining bar scene throughout the city. These diverse watering holes range from traditional and historic to modern and hip. When you’re planning to sip a few drinks at a bar, keep in mind that most places are very casual, laid-back and friendly. As a bonus, it’s also not unusual for the bars to serve customers a small plate of complimentary snacks (such as olives or chips) to accompany the beverages.
Several great bars in the city are:
Skybar – Offering one of the most stunning panoramic views in the city, the chic Skybar is situated atop the luxury Tivoli hotel. With a sprawling terrace as well as plenty of indoor space, Skybar also serves food as well as delectable cocktails.
MiniBar – This whimsical yet modern bar/restaurant created by famed chef Jose Avillez, is not to be missed when visiting Lisbon. Cocktails are surprising and delightful, and the accompanying molecular gastronomic specialties are purely magical.
Red Frog – This hip speakeasy-style bar features exceptionally crafted cocktails made with fresh ingredients. You need to ring the doorbell before you are allowed inside -- and their secret room adds extra intrigue.
Lounge - Popular with the locals, Lounge is a laid-back, roomy bar with a chill, neighborhood vibe. It tends to get busy on weekends, so it’s best to arrive on the early side if you wish to enjoy a cocktail without a big crowd. 
Fabrica Musa – This craft brewery in the Marvila neighborhood (dubbed “Lisbon’s beer district”) features a spacious taproom with great ambiance and a vast array of brews, from crisp lagers to hoppy IPAs.
The slow, melancholic sound of Lisbon’s famous fado music spills out of tiny bars and venues throughout the city, and it’s well worth planning a night around this centuries-old musical style. This is unique to Portugal, and it’s a cool experience that you won’t want to miss.
There are dozens of tiny fado places to choose from — just follow your ears — or head to O Povo, which has free weekday shows from 8 pm featuring a number of up-and-coming performers. To ensure an authentic experience, avoid the ‘fado and dinner’ packages that are advertised throughout the Bairro Alto and Alfama neighborhoods. Instead, pick an unassuming local spot, and you’ll be rewarded with lower prices, good food, and a more authentic experience.
Tip: To gain a more thorough perspective on the music, visit the Fado Museum in Alfama ahead of time, to learn more about the history of this unique soulful sound.
Lisbon clubs are hopping all year long. So, whether you’re after the best international DJs, old-school pop, hip hop or anything in between, Lisbon’s clubs have you covered.
Unlike the casual bars in town, the more exclusive nightclubs have strict dress codes and door policies, with some requiring reservations ahead of time. No matter which club you're planning to visit, dress to impress, don’t expect anywhere to be open before midnight -- and prepare to party until the sun comes up.
A few hot spots include:
The Music Box - This popular venue is located the busy red-light district of Cais do Sodre. You can dance ‘till dawn at this legendary favorite, as it is famous for staying open the latest.
Dock’s Club - A hip destination that’s situated down near the bridge in Alcântara, Dock’s Club gets very busy in the summer and is known for attracting a younger crowd.  
Sabotage Club – If you want to rock ‘till you drop, this is the place! This hard rock club in the Cais do Sodré district shines a spotlight on rock, indie, power pop, punk and more. Check the schedule for their weekly live music.
Lux - This posh dance club is located on the waterfront. It’s considered high-end with prices to match. 
Although Lisbon doesn’t attract as many internally-known acts as larger cities like Madrid or London, there are still many fantastic musical options around town. As with anywhere else, reserve in advance for a popular show, because aside from the larger MEO Arena, most venues are relatively small, so tickets often sell out quickly.
One must-visit venue is Lisbon’s stunning opera house, Teatro Nacional de Sao Carlos, which is located in the Chiado neighborhood in the heart of the city. Music by famous composers (such as Wagner, Mozart, Stravinsky) is regularly performed in this tiny but beautiful, theater that dates back to the 1700s.
While it’s possible to book online, you can usually get seats for all but the most popular shows just by showing up at the box office a few days in advance. If you’re staying at a hotel, your concierge may be able to help obtain tickets if needed.
Tip: Like most concerts, select a few music venues in advance of your visit. You never know which singer or band may be in town!
There are several festivals in Lisbon held throughout the year, and one of the largest is the Feast of St. Anthony that takes place every June. During the month, locals celebrate Festas de Lisboa with the excitement and festivities peaking on June 12, which is the actual feast day of Lisbon’s patron saint. You can’t miss the celebrations. Neighborhoods and streets are decorated and there are live music and entertainment around the city – that go until the early morning hours on weekends. You will also find a seemingly endless assortment of local culinary delights – including the famous grilled sardines – being cooked up outdoors under massive tents.
Note: Hotels often book up months in advance during this popular festival.  
Similar to other southern European countries, the nightlight action in Lisbon kicks off very late. So, unless you’re dining in the more touristy spots, many restaurants don’t open until 7:00 PM, and won’t start getting crowded for an hour or two later.
The local Lisbon bars are packed until well after midnight -- and clubs don’t start hopping until at least 2 AM.
Lisbon is a busy city, especially in summer, so if you have your heart set on a specific restaurant or club, be sure to make a reservation. 
Tipping is not expected. Locals usually “round up” their bill and leave the change for the server or bartender.
Busses and trams in Lisbon are on different schedules, so some stop running earlier than others. (All stop at midnight). But no worries! Uber and taxis are plentiful in Lisbon.
Be sure to leave your drinks in the bar. Aside from the designated festival areas, it’s illegal to walk around Lisbon with an open container of alcohol.
Lisbon can get chilly at night, even in summer. Remember to take a light sweater or jacket with you. 
Lisbon, the charming capital of Portugal in southern Europe, is known for its colorful buildings and great hillside views. Visitors enjoy taking nearly 150-year-old trams and guided walking tours through cobblestone streets, along with exploring historic UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as towers and monasteries. Another popular activity is catching a performance of fado, a type of Portuguese folk music played live at local restaurants and venues. Checking out diverse neighborhoods and tasting local specialties like port wine and sweet pastel de Belém tarts are additional reasons to not miss this beautiful city.

One of the most iconic Lisbon attractions is its historic trams, which have been an integral part of the city's transportation system since 1873.
Tram 28: This wooden tram is one of the most popular and best deals, taking you past most of Lisbon's best sights. See neighborhoods Bairro Alto and Chiado and the cathedral as the tram climbs up to Alfama. You can stay on until the last stop or get off near St. Jorge castle.
Hop-On-Hop-Off Tram: Get on and off as you like while checking out nine stops at beloved Lisbon areas like the downtown Baixa district or the gardens at Estrela Park. The tram includes an audio guide in 12 languages.
Beware of pickpockets, especially on crowded trams and at exit points.

Found in the downtown area of Baixa, the Praça do Comércio (Commerce Square) is Lisbon's most regal plaza. It boasts striking yellow buildings as well as the impressive Arco da Rua Augusta, which leads to Rua Augusta, one of the city's largest shopping avenues. Across from the arch is the Tagus River.
The tourist office in the square is a great first stop for picking up a map and orienting yourself while in Lisbon. Also in the Praça do Comércio is ViniPortugal, where you can enjoy free tastings of wine from different regions of the country.

With so much to see, a guided walking tour is an excellent way to get acquainted with the city's top places, while you learn about the capital's history and local culture.
For a three-hour overview of Lisbon's main sights, including the most historic district of Alfama, Praça do Comércio, and more, enjoy a walking tour that includes a ride on the historic tram, a pastel de nata (pastry tart) and other snacks, and a wine tasting.

Since 1837, the Pastéis de Belém pastry shop has been making delicious pastel de Belém—Portuguese custard tarts sprinkled with cinnamon—using an old recipe from the Jeronimos Monastery. Though they may look very similar to the ones you'll see throughout Lisbon, these tarts are of a much higher quality and can be bought freshly baked (the shop is open daily), sometimes topped with cinnamon and sugar. The tarts taste best when eaten immediately.

Near the Pastéis de Belém is the Mosteiro dos Jeronimos (Jeronimos Monastery), a famous tourist attraction and UNESCO World Heritage Site. This monastery is impressive on the outside, and the inside (with Manueline workmanship) houses the remains of some famous Portuguese people, most notably the explorer Vasco de Gama.
Guided tours are available by reservation outside of regular hours. Also, if you have purchased a Lisboa Card, entry is free.

Fado, a form of Portuguese folk music, tends to be a mournful and emotional ballad, but other styles can be more fun; catching a show is a classic Lisbon attraction.
Most fado performances take place in restaurants (which may require a reservation), clubs, or other venues, often in Alfama or Mouraria. Tasca do Chico in Bairro Alto and Alfama has fado shows (confirm their schedule to be sure).
Gautier Houba
Lisbon's oldest district survived the catastrophic 1755 earthquake, maintaining its old cobblestone streets and structures, a stark contrast with the more spacious modern city.
Alfama is home to some of the city's best mirodouros (lookout points). One of these is located at Castelo San Jorge, a medieval moorish citadel that sits on top of Lisbon's highest hill.
You can reach Alfama by the famed historic tram 28, passing Lisbon's cathedral on the way, which is especially useful if you would like to avoid walking uphill.

The most famous wine in Portugal is port: a sweet, fortified wine, and visitors can try it in Porto, the city where the drink was created, about a 3-hour drive north of Lisbon. Head to Vinhos do Douro e do Porto, which offers a tasting room, wine shop, and guided lab tours on weekdays.
Other popular wines include the fortified madeira, muscatel made from muscat grapes, vinho verde (a light slightly-sparkling wine), and ginja, a sweetened liqueur that infused with sour cherries, widely available in Lisbon, most famously at A Ginjinha.
The Portuguese Food and Wine Tour is an ideal way to learn; you'll walk through Lisbon streets and explore the wine, port, and other drinks, and do plenty of food tasting at pastry and cheese shops, and beyond.

Bairro Alto is party central. From Bica at the bottom end to the area around Travessa da Queimada, you'll find nightlife for most tastes. And it's not just for the young—there are restaurants and fado shows too.
Bica runs along the Bica Funicular railway line and has many bars that have more of an indie/alternative feel to them. Try a beer or a caipirinha (the national cocktail of Brazil). Further up into Bairro Alto, many venues offer live music. Partying usually goes pretty late with people spilling out into the streets, creating a festive, fun atmosphere in Lisbon's (usually) nice weather.

Walking distance from the Baixa district lies Chiado, a neighborhood with a popular shopping and cultural district with theaters and museums. A Brasileira (The Brazilian Lady Cafe), one of the area's oldest and most beloved cafés, is where intellectuals including the poet Fernando Pessoa used to hang out; a bronze statue of the writer sits at an outdoor table.
From the Miradouro de São Pedro de Alcántara, check out the nice views of Baixa, the Tagus River, and the São Jorge Castle on the summit.

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the five-story Belém Tower (Torre de Belém) was built between 1514 and 1520 by the Portuguese architect and sculptor Francisco de Arruda on the Tagus River. One interesting feature of the Lisbon landmark is the rhinoceros gargoyle.
The tower, closed Mondays and certain holidays, is free to anyone with a pre-purchased Lisboa Card.

One fun thing to do is explore the region around Lisbon. The most often visited is Sintra, a resort town about a 35-minute drive from the capital. The Palacio Nacional da Pena is a major tourist attraction not to be missed; the brightly colored palace displays 19th century Romanticism architecture and is surrounded by a lush forest and amazing views. Area parks such as the Sintra-Cascais Natural Park on the Portuguese Riviera—with a stone-age burial chamber, dunes, and other historical and natural sites—are worth viewing as well.

Many enjoy a visit to Cascais, an approximately 45-minute drive from Lisbon, for a taste of a charming coastal fishing resort with 19th-century architecture. The historic center has cobblestone streets and fancy mansions, and the town is home to medieval Fortress Nossa Senhora da Luz de Cascais built in 1594. Tourists also enjoy the Palácio da Cidadela de Cascais (Cascais Citadel Palace), the former home to the governor of the citadel, which opened as a museum in 2011.

Art lovers in Lisbon may want to see The Museu Nacional do Azulejo, a museum all about azulejos, traditional Portuguese decorative ceramic tiles dating back from the 15th century to modern pieces. Housed in the former Madre de Deus Convent, the museum has temporary and permanent exhibitions, as well as a restaurant and cafeteria onsite.
The museum is closed on Mondays and on specific holidays.

Besides being a lovely spot for people watching, the Time Out Market Lisboa at Mercado da Ribeira in the Cais do Sodré neighborhood has something for everyone. It's got over 25 restaurants ranging from Portuguese to pizza to burgers, and several shops and bars. There are also longtime market vendors of fruit, meat, fish, flowers, and more, along with live music and cooking classes.
As Portugal's capital and largest city, Lisbon is well connected to the rest of the country, making it a good jump-off point to explore the rest of the country.
Lisbon has a good metro system that connects with the train and bus stations below.
If you plan on using Lisbon's public transport more than a couple of times a day, you may want to get a day ticket or buy the Lisboa Card.
The trains to and from Sintra, Cascais, and Estoril are also included on the Lisboa card, as is discounted or free entry to just about every attraction in Lisbon.
The Aerobus takes you from the airport to Praça Dom Pedro IV (Metro: Rossio) or to Cais do Sodre train station. Tickets cost around two euros.
If your destination is Estoril or another nearby beach town, there are direct buses from the airport.
Lisbon has two main trains stations, Santa Apolonia and Gare do Oriente. Many trains passing through stop at both stations, so keep that in mind when booking or checking timetables.
There are a few smaller stations throughout Lisbon that serve a few specific destinations, which are listed below.
There are several bus stations in Lisbon, but the one you are most likely to need is Sete Rios.
There's plenty more to see in Portugal than just Lisbon. Let local experts show you the best of the country. All of the guided tours on this page depart from Lisbon, lasting anywhere from half a day to eleven days long. Sample some of Portugal's many different types of wine, see the country's important religious sites and explore lesser-known Portuguese cities.
There are several great day trips to take when in Lisbon. Probably the most popular tour is to Sintra, along with Cascais and the Estoril coast but you could spend a whole day in Sintra.
Many of Portugal's best sights are a short drive from Lisbon. Sintra, Cascais, Fatima, and Obidos are all close to the capital. So there are unsurprisingly several short tours you can do to explore these places.
There are two two-day tours, one where you use your own accommodation in Lisbon and another where you stay the night in Fatima. Or explore further afield with a three-day tour.
Guided tours from Lisbon aren't restricted to trips around Portugal. There are now some tours that reach Spain. Either spend a few days in the Spanish capital, with a day in Toledo ​or take a longer tour and visit southern Spain's most famous cities too.
There are two four-day tours from Lisbon for you to consider: Lisbon, Sintra, Cascais, and Estoril Coast. This tour is great if you planned on taking guided tours while in Lisbon and a day trip to Sintra, Cascais, and Estoril.
You could book your own accommodation and guided tours while in Lisbon and then book one of the day trips to Sintra from above if you wanted more independence, but you probably couldn't top the value of this tour, especially the convenience and time saved by letting the pros do it for you! Four nights of accommodation in Lisbon is included in the price.
This four-day tour goes a little further afield. The Algarve, Portugal's southern coast, has some of Europe's nicest beaches. It also has many interesting sites and history that aren't always explored. Why not take a few days while in Lisbon to go explore the Algarve, and places in between. Stops include Lagos, Sagres, Evora, Beja, and Setubal.
This tour is the greatest hits of northern Portugal. The region has it's own form of Fado (from Coimbra) and is home to Port, the famous fortified wine. Why not head north and discover your favorite type of Port by visiting Porto's port cellars and enjoying a tasting or two?
This tour is called the best of Portugal for a reason. It hits much of the north, and in addition to the cities covered in the above six-day trip, it also goes to the Douro Valley, home to the beautiful vineyards of the Douro wine and Port. It also takes you to all the popular towns in the Lisbon and you also make your way to the beautiful Algarve coast.
This best of Portugal and Spain covers the central southern points of the Iberian Peninsula. It includes stops in Lisbon, Evora, Algarve Coast, Seville, Granada, Cordoba, Madrid, Valencia and ending in Barcelona. You could easily extend your time in Lisbon or Barcelona, should you want to explore these wonderful cities more in-depth.
The port town of Faro, in Portugal's Algarve region, is a regular arrival point for visitors to Portugal. The sunny shores of the Algarve attract many flights bringing tourists in search of summer fun. But Portugal is culturally rich and worth exploring, and Faro is the perfect jumping-off point to explore Lisbon as well. The capital also attracts a lot of summer tourists and boasts an array of interesting attractions. You can also book Portugal tours from Lisbon and take day trips from both Lisbon and Faro.
If you are only flying to Faro to take a train to Lisbon, consider going via Porto instead—its connections with Lisbon are better, and the city and its surrounding wineries are a vibrant destination in the summer. 
The train is a little quicker than the bus between Faro and Lisbon, but it's also a bit more expensive. If you don't mind the bus, you could make your choice based on which station is closest to your hotel in Lisbon. Faro is so small that which type of transportation you choose won't affect the convenience of your departure from there one way or another. 
There are two types of trains that go from Lisbon to Faro. The trip takes just under three hours if you take the fast train, called the Alfa Pendular, or three hours and 45 minutes if you take the Intercidade. They cost about the same.
The bus from Lisbon to Faro, like the Intercidade, takes about three hours and 45 minutes but costs a bit less than the train. You can book a bus ticket from Rede Expressos or RENEX. Both bus companies offer comparable prices and journey times. 
Check this list of Lisbon train and bus stations and Faro train and bus stations to help you find the quickest route.
If you like road trips and would like to have the convenience of a car to make stops along the way and during your stay in Lisbon, driving might be your best option. The trip from Lisbon to Faro takes about two hours and 45 minutes by car and is about 280 kilometers, or 175 miles, traveling mainly by the A2 road. The A2 is a toll road, and this could push your travel costs up significantly. But if you don't particularly care about having a car in Lisbon and unless you're traveling with a full car, you might find it cheaper and easier to travel by bus or train.
While it might be a more expensive option, the drive is scenic, and it gives you the option of stopping in Evora and the Alentejo wine regions.
You can take a flight from Lisbon to Faro, but it will cost you many times the price of a train or bus ticket. Flights take 45 minutes, but when you add on the time it takes to get to and from the airport and check-in time, the difference in the amount of time the two options take diminishes.
Among the largest metro regions in Europe, Lisbon is the capital city of Portugal, which has steadily developed a reputation as a center of gay-friendliness and tolerance - in 2010, Portugal legalized gay marriage. In late June, GLBT persons from throughout Portugal come to the capital for Lisbon Gay Pride. The date this year of the Lisbon Pride Parade (Marcha do Orgulho LGBT) is Saturday, June 18, 2016, from 5 pm onward, at Jardim do Principe Real.
Then the following weekend, on Saturday, June 25, from 4 pm until 4 am, the Lisbon Pride Village (Arraial Lisboa Pride) is the site of gay bars, entertainment, and more.
A few weeks earlier, in late May, the city also holds a Lisbon Bear Pride, a six-day event hosted by bear bar TR3S Lisboa. Festivities include dance parties, bar nights, pool & sauna, contests, and more. The dates this year are May 25 through 30, 2016.
Lisbon Gay Resources
During Pride, gay-popular bars, restaurants, hotels, and shops in the area have more going on than usual during Pride week. Check online resources about the Budapest gay scene, such as the Lisbon Gay Guide at Patroc.com, and the Go Lisbon Gay Guide. Also take a look at the excellent visitor site produced by the country's official tourism organization, the Turismo de Portugal.
Portugal is one of the most affordable countries in Western Europe, and unsurprisingly, Lisbon one of its most affordable capitals. As a result, it’s easy to experience some of the best the city has to offer without putting much of a dent in your bank balance, whether you’re traveling on a budget or not.
From castles and museums to tours and beaches, eating, drinking and more, here are ten things worth doing in Lisbon that’ll set you back less than ten euros.

Lisbon’s castle is pretty hard to miss, perched at the top of a hill downtown above the old Alfama neighborhood. It’s a steep 20-30 minute walk up to the entrance, but once you’ve persevered, you’re treated to some of the best views in the city.
For those who’d prefer not to navigate the maze of streets, tuk-tuks, trams, and taxis can get you there without the burning calf muscles.
Dating back to the 11th century, and now a National Monument, your €8.50 ticket gives you access to the grounds, including walking along the old defensive walls. Expect long lines at peak times, but there’s plenty of space once you’ve made it inside.
Be sure to wear appropriate footwear, especially if there's any rain in the forecast. The cobbled streets can get quite slippery when wet, and your feet will be less sore at the end of the day regardless of the weather.

Lisbon’s nostalgic trams are as famous as its hilly streets, and the two things go hand in hand for weary tourists and locals alike.
The most scenic line is the #28, which starts in Martim Moniz, then rattles its way on a loop through the city and out to the Campo de Ourique neighborhood, taking in many of the city’s main attractions along the way.
You’ll pay €2.90 if you buy a ticket from the driver, but to save time and money, get a single or day pass from a nearby metro station instead. They're significantly cheaper, and you won't be the person holding up a long line of people as you fumble for change when you enter.
Don’t forget to validate your ticket when you get on board, expect large crowds in summer, and keep an eye on your belongings—pickpockets are known to operate when the tram gets busy.
If you'd like a less-crowded journey, try taking the tram in the reverse direction (ie, from Campo do Ourique back to Martim Moniz.) You'll see all the same things, but often won't have to share it with quite as many people.
A visit to a tile museum doesn’t sound very exciting—but this is no ordinary tile museum.
Azulejos, the beautiful blue Portuguese tiles, can be found on buildings throughout Lisbon (and the rest of Portugal), and the Museu Nacional do Azulejo does a great job of displaying and explaining five centuries of tile history.
Entry is a reasonable five euros, and you can expect to spend a couple of hours exploring the temporary and permanent collections. The museum has released a free app, which also functions as an audio guide in Portuguese and English, and there's even free Wi-Fi in the lobby to download it.
It’s a roughly 20-minute walk from Santa Apolonia train station, at the bottom of the Alfama neighborhood, or you could take a quick taxi from further afield.
Kiosks (or quiosques in Portuguese) are everywhere in Lisbon, especially in parks, squares, and other public spaces. These small booths typically offer inexpensive drinks and snacks, and you’ll find locals making full use of them throughout the year.
Whether you’re after a quick coffee before continuing with the sightseeing, or a more leisurely glass of beer or wine as the sun starts to set, grab a drink, find a table, and enjoy the experience. With an espresso as little as 60 cents, and a large wine often just a couple of euros, there’s no reason not to!
You’ll almost always order at the counter, although staff may occasionally pass by and ask if you’d like another drink if things aren’t too busy.

 Despite its hills, Lisbon is a very walkable city, and several free tours have popped up to help visitors do exactly that. One of the most popular is run by Sandemans, typically a couple of times per day.
Departing from the central Largo de Camões square, the three-hour tour winds around the Alfama, Bairro Alto and Chiado neighborhoods, explaining the buildings and history along the way. Unusually for free tours like this, you can book a spot online ahead of time, and they run almost every day throughout the year.
Even though you’re not charged for the tour itself, the guides get paid via tips, so be sure to give them an appropriate amount at the end if you enjoyed the experience.

Perched on (or at high tide, in) the Tagus river, the small Belém Tower was once the gateway to the city for ship traffic, as well as an important part of its defenses.
It opens at 10 a.m., and it’s worth getting there around that time – lines get longer throughout the day, and with only a single narrow staircase to get up to the top, they don’t move particularly fast either.
Once you’ve made it up to the viewing area, though, you’ll be rewarded with great views of the river and city, and out to the Atlantic.
You’ll pay €6 for an adult ticket, although you can also buy combination passes that give access to other attractions in the area, including the imposing Jerónimos Monastery.
After climbing up and down those 200+ steps in Belém Tower, you’ll likely have worked up an appetite. Fortunately, the original and best pastel del natas in the city are just a few minutes away, at Pastéis de Belém.
These delicious Portuguese egg tarts have become well-known around the world, but until you’ve had one from the source, you haven’t truly experienced this glorious sweet treat. Expect long lines most of the day, although you’ll get served faster in the late evening, or shortly after opening.
The tasty snacks cost a little over a euro each, although if you can get away with only buying one, you’ve got more willpower than me. If you can’t make it out to Belem, you’ll pay a similar amount at other bakeries in the central city.

Sure, you can take a cruise to explore the Tagus River estuary that divides Lisbon from Almada, but it’s not particularly budget-friendly. For a much cheaper, albeit shorter trip on the water, jump on one of the commuter ferries that cross backwards and forwards several dozen times a day.
The easiest journey runs from Cais do Sodré to Cacilhas, and costs a little over a euro each way. The best part is the views back towards Lisbon, but once you’ve arrived, you can check out a restored Portuguese sailing ship, or jump on a direct bus to the beach at Costa da Caparica or the famous Criso Rei (Christ the Redeemer) statue.
Other Tagus ferry options include a quick trip from Belem to Trafaria, or longer journeys on fast catamarans that cost a little more.
For a European capital, Lisbon is fortunate to have several high-quality beaches within easy reach of the city center. Whether you’re traveling by train, bus, tram or ferry, you’ll only pay a few euros for a return ticket to either Cascais or Costa Caparica.
Once you’re there, lay your towel out and enjoy the sunshine and crashing waves for a few hours. When you get peckish, there are dozens of food and drink options right beside the ocean, with cheaper options further back from the water.
If you’re on a budget but prefer your beaches a little less busy, take advantage of the free bike here outside the train station in Cascais, and pedal out to Praia do Guincho instead.
No matter which patch of sand you opt for though, don’t forget the sunscreen. The Portuguese sun is strong, and the regular ocean breeze means you often won’t feel yourself burning until it’s too late!
The Portuguese food scene is greatly underrated — the country has some of the best seafood in the world, and local chefs take full advantage of it. As an example, there are supposedly more recipes just for salted cod than there are days in the year!
While Lisbon has its fair share of high-end restaurants (including several with Michelin stars), and plenty of tourist places that’ll charge a small fortune for mediocre food, it’s easy to find delicious, filling meals for well under ten euros.
Keep an eye out for the magic words ‘menu do dia’ (menu of the day) outside small, unassuming restaurants as you wander away from the tourist hotspots.
Typically, you’ll get a starter or dessert, plus a substantial, often seafood-based main dish, along with water, wine and an espresso coffee, for around seven or eight euros. For tasty food on a budget in Lisbon, you just can’t go past it.
Lisbon is the capital of Portugal, and an excellent first stop on a journey to visit the Andalusian province's capital city of Seville in Spain. Fortunately, Lisbon is located just 400 kilometers (250 miles) from Seville, making travel between the two major cities on the Iberian peninsula relatively easy.
After you're done experiencing the culture of Lisbon, you'll want to head to Seville, which offers an entirely different currency and culture, serving as the center of government for the autonomous southernmost region of Spain.
Because of the relatively close distance between Lisbon and Seville, there are several ways to get between them, including by bus, plane, train, and car. However, the best way to really experience the most of your trip is to drive between them and take in some other cities and sights along the way.
Setting out from Lisbon by car, you'll want to head east toward the Portuguese city of Evora before continuing eastward to the Spanish city of Mérida then south toward Seville. The entire journey will take about five hours driving, but you'll want to plan an extra day or two for your trip if you truly want to enjoy these additional cities.
Evora is the capital of Portugal's Alentejo wine region and also has some great Roman ruins as well, and Mérida has Spain's best-preserved Roman ruins with an amphitheater in such good condition that local actors still put on performances there.
Although the "coastal" route sounds nice, there are no major highways close enough to Portugal's coast to really see anything and no major cities to experience along the way. However, if you have several weeks to complete your journey, this may be a preferred route for someone trying to get a small taste of the local culture of this southwestern region of Portugal.
The most direct way to get between Lisbon and Seville by public transit options is through the bus services run by ALSA. The bus route from Lisbon to Seville takes seven-and-a-half hours, and ALSA also runs buses from Lisbon to Evora, Evora to Mérida, and Mérida to Seville if you want to see the same cities as you would by driving without renting a car for yourself.
Unfortunately, there are no trains directly from Lisbon to Seville, but if you have a rail pass and prefer to travel by train, there are trains from Lisbon to Madrid and from Lisbon to Salamanca, which both offer train service to Seville (from Spain). Alternatively, you can take a train from Lisbon to Faro then take a bus from Faro to Seville.
There are cheap flights from Lisbon to Seville (with TAP Portugal), and the flight only takes one hour. This is the most convenient way to get between Seville and Lisbon but is still more expensive than the other two. Additionally, you entirely miss out on all the sights between these two old cities by flying over them.
