With so many free things in Copenhagen, you don't have to fall into the tourist trap and overpay. No, in Copenhagen, there are numerous free attractions and other things visitors can get for free...here are the best.
The Little Mermaid sits close to the shore of the cruise harbor "Langelinie" on her granite resting place, in the old harbor of Nyhavn. It is a short walk from the main cruise pier, nearby many of Copenhagen’s other major attractions.
The changing of the guard in Copenhagen takes place every day at Amalienborg Palace, no matter what the weather in Denmark might be like. While guards change positions every two hours, the main event for visitors is the changing of the entire guard at noon.
The King’s Garden (Kongens Have) at Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen is Denmark's most popular royal castle. Look for the Hercules Pavillon and the statue of Hans Christian Andersen. In the summer months, there are puppet shows for children and the lawns are crowded with sunbathers.

The Stroget is Copenhagen's famous pedestrian shopping area and is one of the major free attractions in Copenhagen. If you're not a shopper, you'll have no issues visiting the Stroget without spending a single Kroner.

While the city of Copenhagen has plenty of tours of its own and enough entertainment, restaurants, and bars to keep you busy day and night for weeks, there are also a number of great destinations nearby that are perfect for day trips. Explore Copenhagen's (and Denmark's) interesting history with castle and museum visits, relax in the sun away from the big city at an island or beach destination, or tour the sights at some neighboring cities. No matter what you choose to do, you're sure to find a nearby adventure.
Take a royal-themed day trip to North Zealand including a tour of Frederiksborg Castle, which is also home to Denmark's Museum of National History. You can learn about the flamboyant King Christian IV who once lived here, walk through rooms like the Coronation Chapel, and then stroll through the castle’s French Baroque gardens with a guide. Be sure to stop and take some photos of Fredensborg Castle, the annual summer residence of the Danish royal family. If you want to learn more about what you're seeing, the museum offers guided tours for visitors. 
Getting There: You can reach the castle by car (a 40-minute drive) by taking highway 16 toward Hillerød. Or by public transportation, take the S-train line E to Hillerød, and walk 15 to 20 minutes from the station to the castle, either through town or along the lake. 
Travel Tip: If you'd like to take a guided day trip to see all this, you can book a reservation online. It departs from City Hall Square in Copenhagen at 10:30 a.m. from May to September and takes about 6.5 hours. The tour is informative and interesting. 
One of the most beloved day trips from Copenhagen goes to the city of Aarhus, a historic city on the east coast of​ Jutland (Denmark's western peninsula). It offers a great selection of nightlife entertainment and also annual events, such as The Viking Festival in July, in which people gather to recreate the early days of the city with markets, sword-fighting, and more. The city is also home to the contemporary art museum, ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum, botanical gardens, and a palace. 
Getting There: The quickest option is to fly to Aarhus from Copenhagen, which takes about 45 minutes. Or if you prefer to take a train, the journey is about three hours and trains leave the city every 30 to 45 minutes. Driving takes about three hours. Take the E20 west until you hit the E45, and go north on the E45 to Aarhus. 
Travel Tip: If you're not in town during the festival, you should visit the Viking Museum for a glimpse into this significant aspect of the city's past. 
Also known as Denmark's Garden Island, the wildly romantic island of Fyn (Funen) is the home to many fairy tales, and it's also the birthplace of writer Hans Christian Andersen. Fyn is also home to a number of beautiful castles (known as slots in ​Danish), like Nyborg Slot, Egeskov Slot, Broholm Gods, Holckenhavn Slot, and Harridslevgaard Slot.
You can spend all day wandering through the rolling hills checking out acres of orchards and a variety of old farmhouses or head over to the open-air museum Den Fynske Landsby (Fyn Village) and Odense Zoo.
Getting There: Accessing the island is relatively easy. If you drive, it's about an hour and a half, and there is a toll bridge. There's also a direct train between Copenhagen and Funen that is typically a little quicker than driving. 
Travel Tip: The island of Fyn has a strong culinary scene—it hosts several food events and festivals, and it's home to several great restaurants. Don't skip the chance to indulge while you're here! 
One of the best day trips from Copenhagen has to be a visit to the islands of Lolland and Falster. These islands offer things to do no matter which town you are visiting, but Maribo has several attractions to see. 
If you're in Maribo, consider visiting the Museumsbanen (Museum Train), Nakskov's Green World Zoo, and the submarine U-359, but you can also visit a 12th-century royal residence, Ålholm Castle, in the town of Nysted, and don't forget Knuthenborg Manor with its Safari Park (open April-October).
Getting There: Lolland is connected to Denmark's Zealand by a bridge. A day trip from Copenhagen to Lolland is an 80-mile drive along the E47 road south.
Travel Tip: This destination is home to beautiful nature and plenty of adventure activities. While here, try a few, such as biking, kayaking, fishing, golfing, and more.

Local whiskey, pristine beaches, and the remains of Tycho Brahe's 16th-century observatory are the top attractions on the island, but the 360 inhabitants of the island also offer a number of local cuisines, crafts, and shops to browse.
If you're looking to escape all the noise of the cities to a peaceful, secluded location, this tiny island is like a little piece of heaven on earth.
Getting There: Located between Denmark and Sweden, the ferry from Copenhagen takes about 90 minutes to get to Hven Island. If you prefer to drive, it takes about two hours along the E20. 
Travel Tip: If you're a whiskey drinker, head to the Spirit of Hven Distillery for a tasting.
If you're in the mood for sandy beaches and a day of relaxation, plan your day trip from Copenhagen to the sunny island of Bornholm. This is the place to lean back, stroll through the sand, or maybe rent a bicycle for an afternoon.
A popular summer travel destination, Bornholm's nickname is the Pearl of the Baltic. 
Getting There: The biggest town on the island is Rønne, which is also the point of arrival for travelers to Bornholm, and there are direct 35-minute flights from Copenhagen that fly into Rønne-Bornholm Airport. That's by far the quickest and easiest way to get there. If you go by car, bus, or train, the trip can take up to three or four hours as you'll have to go into Sweden to take a bridge.
Travel Tip: Check out Baltic Sea Glass, a glass studio and shop on the island that has beautiful and unique works of glass art.

For an even more intimate day trip, perhaps for a honeymoon or a romantic weekend getaway, the small village of Dragør offers a bit of Danish history with all the amenities of the modern day.
Located just southeast of Copenhagen, this preserved village was founded in the 12th century as a fishing port for Denmark. For a closer look at early life in Dragør, spend the day at the Amager Museum, an open-air recreation of life in the old days, or the Dragør Museum in the harbor.
Getting There: Dragør is about a 15- to 20-minute drive southeast of Copenhagen. You can also take a train or bus, both taking about 30 minutes.
Travel Tip: The Amager Museum is closed on Mondays, so plan accordingly.

Located near city of Borre on the island of Møn, the Møns Klint is a three-mile stretch of chalk cliffs considered to be one of Denmark's natural wonders.
You can spend the night at a campsite just above the cliffs or down by the beach, or if you're interested in geology and science, visit the GeoCenter Møns Klint, Northern Europe's most modern science center. 
Getting There: The island of Møn is about an hour drive to the south along the E20 to the E47. That's typically the quickest and cheapest way, but there's also a direct train between the two places that takes about 1.5 to two hours. 
Travel Tip: Besides just taking in the beauty of the cliffs, there are also a few hiking trails around them you can take. And it's also possible to find fossils in the area, so be on the lookout! 
Not far from Helsingør in Humlebæk, the Lousiana Museum of Modern Art houses one of the region's largest collections of Danish art. When opened in 1952, the museum was originally intended for exclusively Danish art pieces but expanded soon after to include famous works from all around the world.
This museum served an important role in developing Denmark's cultural history and has been credited with teaching the Danish citizenry to look at and appreciate art. 
Getting There: Driving or taking the direct train are your best bets, as Humlebæk is only a 30-minute journey with either option. 
Travel Tip: The city of Humlebæk is also a great destination for some traditional Danish restaurants, but you'll have to travel up to Helsingør if you hope to stay the night nearby.
Located just southeast of Copenhagen in Kastrup, Denmark—near the Danish end of the Øresund Bridge and the Københavns Lufthavn airport—Den Blå Planet is easily accessible by train from the city.
Den Blå Planet is Northeastern Europe's largest aquarium and allows guests to get up close with sharks, sea otters, and all manner of ocean life. 
Getting There: Kastrup is only a 20-minute drive south from Copenhagen, and there's also a direct train that takes only about 15 minutes, so choose whichever option best fits your plans for your trip. 
Travel Tip: While there, you can also take a behind-the-scenes tour of the aquarium or even get a chance to dive with sharks! 
One of the most popular ways to really experience the history, culture, and architecture of Denmark's capital region is to take the Grand Day Trip, a small group guided tour of three major castles including the UNESCO heritage site Kronberg Castle.
On the tour, you'll get to visit Roskilde Cathedral, the burial place to more Kings and Queens than anywhere on earth, before heading to Frederiksborg Castle, the biggest Scandinavian Renaissance-era castle still standing. 
Getting There: The tour leaves from the area across from City Hall in Copenhagen. 
Travel Tip: Bring your camera to photograph the beautiful nature of the Danish Riviera.

You could spend an entire day at the Maritime Museum of Denmark, which tells the story of Denmark's seafaring history through permanent and rotating exhibitions like "In the Shadow of War" and "Ships of all Times."
Almost invisible from the street, this underground museum is worth the trip to see the architecture alone, but you can also learn more about how Denmark became known as one of the world's leading maritime nations.
Getting There: You can get to Helsingør by a 30- to 40-minute drive, or you can also take a train from Copenhagen Central Station that takes about an hour. 
Travel Tip: When you're done exploring the museum, head to Kronborg, a 16th century castle that was also the setting of Shakespeare's "Hamlet."
A little off the beaten path but worth the trip if you're a fan of elegant architecture and Denmark's rich cultural heritage. The town of Kalunborg is home to the Church of Our Lady, a five-towered church built in the late 1100s.
This historic church has experienced many renovations, updates, and additions over the centuries, but spending the day in Medieval Old Town Kalundborg combined with a tour of this stunning chapel make for a great day trip back in time.
Getting There: The cheapest and quickest way to get there is to drive, which will take you about an hour and a half along routes 21 or 23. The train ride there is about two hours and includes some transfers.
Travel Tip: If you're in the area during summer, you can also see the gorgeous gardens at Birkegårdens Haver from May to mid-September.
If you'd rather take a break from Copenhagen entirely or just have a few extra days to add to your itinerary, you should consider taking a  day trip to Sweden.
Visiting the Swedish cities of Helsingborg, Lund, and Malmö is a great way to catch a glimpse of the nearby but entirely different Swedish culture.
Getting There: You have several options to get to these destinations depending on what you plan to do and how flexible you want to be. All options will take you over the Oresund Bridge, and it takes about 40 minutes to an hour to get from Copenhagen to Malmö. 
Travel Tip: There are several guided tours that you can take from Copenhagen to one of these cities in just one day, so you don't have to worry about transportation. Look here for tour options.
There are several types of transportation you can use to get from Copenhagen, Denmark, to Malmö, Sweden, and back; the distance between the cities isn't far. Your transportation options can usually be booked in advance, but each option has pros and cons.
Copenhagen is the largest city in Scandinavia and a is a popular tourist destination and port of call for passenger ships. Malmö is Sweden’s third-largest city with a castle and enchanting old town center. In contrast, Malmö has a redeveloped waterfront with promenades and has Scandinavia's tallest building. It's a progressive, vibrant town.
The Oresund Bridge links Denmark and Sweden and was completed in 2000. The $4 billion bridge/tunnel project consists of a 5-mile bridge, 2.5-mile tunnel, and a man-made island. 
Here's a closer look at four ways to get between Copenhagen and Malmö.
Taking the train from Copenhagen to Malmö is a popular option and only takes 35 minutes across the famous Oresund Bridge. The train departs either city's central train station every 20 minutes and stops intermittently at locations such as at Copenhagen Kastrup Airport. The advantage here is a flexible schedule and low price since you won't have to pay a bridge toll. You can purchase your ticket locally or order flexible train passes for Denmark and Sweden at RailEurope.com before you go so you don't have to worry about getting tickets.
If you'd like to rent a car to get from Copenhagen to Malmö, it's a 45-minute drive (45 kilometers or 28 miles). Simply take the E20 across the Oresund Bridge (54 euro toll required). It's a beautiful and memorable drive through the tunnel and across the bridge, but you'll pay for gas and the bridge toll.
If you are going to be traveling across this bridge more than a couple of times, you can purchase a Bropas (bridge pass), which will give you half-off pricing. 
You can also save by using the "SmutTur" (getaway) discount which is available all weekdays from 5 p.m. to 12 a.m., as well as all day on weekends and holidays when you return within six hours. The six hours begin when you pass the toll station on the Swedish side.
Here's probably the cheapest option: Take the Flybus 737 from Copenhagen to Malmo across the Oresund Bridge. It's a direct bus line commuting between the airports of the two cities and also coincides with Ryanair flight arrivals from the UK. From Copenhagen, the bus to Malmö departs on Ingerslevsgade. In Malmö, you'll find the bus to Copenhagen right outside Malmö airport. You can also take the Greyhound bus (Gråhund). Look for bus line 999.
You can also take a guided bus tour from Copenhagen to Malmö, such as the Swedish Day Trip from Copenhagen (unfortunately, it's not available year-round). This full-day tour contains bus and ferry transportation and guided group sightseeing of the Copenhagen-Malmö region.
Malmö is located in between Malmo Sturup Airport and Copenhagen Kastrup International Airport, so flying from Copenhagen to Malmö or back doesn't really make any sense. You can fly directly to either Copenhagen or Malmö from other cities in Europe and then start your exploration of these two interesting and vibrant cities joined by a bridge that is a marvel of engineering.

Copenhagen, Denmark is the largest city in Scandinavia, with lots to see and do for everyone. Copenhagen is also a very popular port of call or embarkation point for cruise ships sailing to the Baltic capitals.
Copenhagen is a great city to walk in—it has flat terrain with no skyscrapers and few automobiles. So whether you have just a day in the city or are there for a vacation, you'll enjoy the traditional sights, like the Little Mermaid Statue, along with contemporary attractions like walking and shopping the Stroget pedestrian-only street.

 Tivoli Gardens is Copenhagen's most popular tourist destination. Millions of people fill the gardens, dine in the 40 restaurants, enjoy the entertainment, ride the amusement rides, play the games, or just sit and eat ice cream and people-watch from mid-April to late September each year.
Tivoli was opened in 1843, and it was once on the western edge of the city. Today it is in the center of Copenhagen and, for those on a cruise, it is only a short taxi ride from the Langelinie cruise ship pier.
The entertainment varies each day, so be sure to pick up a map and schedule when you pay the entry fee at the gate. Tivoli is at its best at night, when over 100,000 colored lanterns light up the gardens.

The iconic Little Mermaid statue is a must-see for visitors to Copenhagen and is only a 10-minute walk from the cruise ship pier. At less than five feet tall, the little statue is much smaller than most people expect, and she sits on a rock near the shore, not in the middle of the harbor.
Hans Christian Andersen wrote "The Little Mermaid" fairy tale in 1837, and in 1909 the founder of Carlsberg Breweries, who was fascinated by the story, had the statue built.
The Little Mermaid statue has sat on her boulder since August 23, 1913, but has had a very turbulent life, with at least eight vandalism attacks. She has been dowsed in paint numerous times, had her right arm amputated, been decapitated three times, and even pushed from her rock in 2003. Fortunately, the sculptor made a mold, so the Little Mermaid's "parts" have been re-created by recasting the bronze using the original mold.

The City Hall is near Tivoli Gardens and the Stroget pedestrian mall and is a good place to start a tour of Copenhagen. The lobby has a good selection of tourist information and maps. The City Hall is free except for the 300-step climb to the top of the tower, which will cost 40 DKK (or free with the Copenhagen Card). The large atrium of the City Hall was inspired by the City Hall in Siena, Italy.
On the exterior front of the City Hall are large polar bears that symbolize Greenland, which is still a protectorate of Denmark.

Before starting a stroll down the pedestrian mall of Stroget, look at the top of the Philips (or Richshuset) building on the opposite side of City Hall square. The golden weather girls used to tell the weather before the mechanism broke. One girl on a bicycle would rotate to the front when it was sunny, and the second girl with an umbrella would rotate to the front when it was rainy. Below them is a long, neon thermometer, also from the 1930s, which still works today.

One of Europe's longest pedestrian streets, The Stroget is home to shops ranging from budget-friendly chains to some of the world's priciest upscale brands. The Stroget is 1.1 kilometers long and runs from City Hall Square to Kongens Nytorv, the largest square of the city.
You can shop 'til you drop at stores like Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, and Mulberry. Shops like H&M, Vero Moda, and Zara are found closer to City Hall Square. As you walk, enjoy the street entertainers.
The Stroget pedestrian mall is also a wonderful place to experience some of the sights of Copenhagen. The Stroget is actually a series of streets that weave through downtown Copenhagen from the City Hall to the Nyhavn harbor. You can walk the length of Stroget in 30 minutes, but it will take you a half-day if you take in many of the side streets.

This statue of children's author Hans Christian Andersen (1805-1875), known best for his fairy tales, is located in King's Garden. Visitors of all ages love to sit on his lap and have their photo taken. Note how shiny his knees are!

This Fountain of Charity in Gammel Torv (Old Square) is only one of the fascinating sites on the Stroget. Although the statue has been in Gammel Torv since the 1600s, the two figures were considered controversial during the Victorian era, and the statue was put high on this pedestal so that the pregnant nude woman and the young boy would not be so noticeable.
Near Gammel Torv is the marvelous neoclassical Lutheran church, the Cathedral of Our Lady. It looks much like a Greek Temple, with all the Apostles in Roman togas. The church has marvelous acoustics and free organ concerts each Saturday at noon.

Nyhavn Harbor in Copenhagen, Denmark is a good place to eat outside and enjoy a summer day. The old sailors' quarters have been converted into colorful trendy cafes, bars, and jazz clubs.
Inside the bridge area, the harbor is actually a museum and historic ship harbor where only members of the Association of Wooden Ships are admitted or guests with vessels of special historical interest.
The Nyhavn canal is filled with sailboats and is also the best place to take a tour on one of the many Copenhagen harbor cruise and canal cruise boats.

Christiansborg Castle Square in Copenhagen, Denmark is the site of a complex of government buildings, including the Parliament, Supreme Court, and Prime Minister's office. The royal family has not lived at Christianborg for over 200 years but uses the palace for special occasions. You can't wander around the palace alone, but the 50-minute English language tour of the palace is well worth the cost.
To find the entrance to the Christiansborg Palace tours, enter the wooden door behind the equestrian statue, go past the entrance to the Christianborg ruins, then into a courtyard and up the stairs on the right. A tour provides great information on the Danish royal family and its connection to the royals of other European countries. The highlight of the tour is the collection of modern wall tapestries given to the Queen which were made by Gobelin of Paris and are some of the most spectacular you will ever see.

The Copenhagen Jazz Festival is held each July in Copenhagen. The balloon in the photo was used in one of the parades for the Jazz Festival. Jazz musicians from around the world perform practically non-stop at Tivoli Gardens and around the city both indoors and outdoors. Many of the performances, many of them family-friendly, are free.

The Amalienborg Palace is the home of the Danish Royal family. The Amalienborg Museum allows visitors to see the private interiors of the most recent past kings and queens and an exhibit on the monarchy today.
Amalienborg is famous for its Royal Guard (Den Kongelige Livgarde). The changing of the guards takes place daily. See the guards march from their barracks in 100 Gothersgade by Rosenborg Castle through the streets of Copenhagen and end up at Amalienborg, where the changing of the guard takes place at 12:00 noon.

The Oresund Bridge links Denmark and Sweden. Constructed less than 20 years ago, the bridge is touted as providing this connection for the first time since the end of the Ice Age over 7000 years ago. The $4 billion bridge/tunnel project was completed in 2000 and consists of a 5-mile bridge, 2.5-mile tunnel, and a man-made island.
Malmo, Sweden, the third-largest city in Sweden, is just 35 minutes away from Copenhagen via the train across the Oresund Straits. The bridge toll for a car is about 45 euros.
Copenhagen and Bergen are separated by a distance of about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), which can be covered in several different ways by travelers. Each transportation option between Copenhagen and Bergen has its own pros and cons.
Taking one of the hour-and-a-half direct flights by SAS or Norwegian is definitely a good option if you want to get to Bergen or back to Copenhagen quickly. The prices for a one-way ticket aren't too expensive if you book a bit in advance. The ticket prices will add up if you need round trip tickets for the entire family, though, so other transportation options might be more suitable.
It'll be a long journey if you want to take the train. There is no direct rail connection between Copenhagen and Bergen. You have to travel via Oslo and you'll need about one and a half days (still not as long as the bus option, though). You can book tickets on RailEurope.com. Getting ​from Bergen to Oslo by train takes seven hours alone but it is a scenic journey and the best option for travelers who have time to spare. A Eurail Pass ticket for Scandinavia is another more flexible, cost-saving option. It is reasonably priced and can cover Denmark, Norway, and Sweden all at once.
Quite a few travelers just rent a car. There are two main routes taken by drivers between these cities, and the travel time of 12 to 13 hours is the same for each route. The more scenic drive takes you across the Øresund Bridge and through Malmö. Then, follow the E6/E20 north merge onto the E16 to Bergen.
The second option involves the short Helsingør/Helsingborg ferry (which departs frequently) and the same road heading north thereafter. To drive from Bergen to Copenhagen instead, simply reverse the directions.
If you're focusing on keeping your travel budget as low as possible, nothing beats the bus. Yes, it's slow. Yes, it can be uncomfortable. But it's also the cheapest transportation option and can be relaxing. Keep in mind you'll spend 18 hours on the bus to get from Copenhagen to Bergen and that doesn't include waiting for your connection.
Swebus Express bus line 820 connects Copenhagen (select bus station named "Köpenhamn") and Oslo. Between Oslo and Bergen, use Nor-Way Bussekspress, which offers daily morning departures in each direction.
Pricey, but pretty. This is a beautiful ship journey, assuming you want the Copenhagen-Bergen connection to be the focal point of your visit. Scantours and CruiseDirect even offer complete cruise tours that have both cities as ports of call and can be joined for the Copenhagen-Bergen trip. Pick this option if you have a decent travel budget and several days available.
On a cheaper note, you can also just book the Copenhagen-Oslo ferry and then travel from Oslo to Bergen with a different type of transportation.
When traveling in Denmark from Copenhagen to Aarhus (and from Aarhus to Copenhagen), travelers have a good selection of different transportation options. However, each option has its own pros and cons.
Find out here which fits best for your trip from Copenhagen to Aarhus. Here are the five transportation options to consider.
Flying between Copenhagen and Aarhus only takes about 45 minutes and there are several direct flights daily, offered by SAS and others. This is a good option mainly for travelers pressed for time. Otherwise, the disadvantages are the price tag and that there's not much to look at during the trip.  
Taking the train from Copenhagen to Stockholm usually costs a little less than plane tickets and is a good option if you want to stay flexible. It also takes longer (about three hours) to travel between Copenhagen and Aarhus, though. Trains leave either city every 30 to 45 minutes and the train ride is scenic and relaxing. You can get flexible train tickets and compare prices at RailEurope.com.
Driving between Copenhagen and Aarhus is suitable if you have about four hours of time for the 300 kilometers (185 miles) distance, a rental car and are ready for a scenic drive. There are two routes you can take: The easy option includes a toll road and the bridge across Storebælt (DKK 200-330). From Copenhagen, take the E20 west until you hit the E45. Go north on the E45 to Aarhus. Or avoid the toll route and take a ferry part of the way (DKK 300-700). This way, just go northwest on road 21 to Sjaellands-Odde and take the Mols Line ferry to Aarhus from there.​
To use a ferry between Copenhagen and Aarhus, take a look at the second driving option above.
This is a viable option that leaves travelers flexible, relaxed and with money to spare. The  Abildskou bus line 888 connects Copenhagen and Aarhus daily. It's comparatively inexpensive for an adult bus ticket, paid directly to the bus driver. The Copenhagen-Aarhus trip takes about three hours.
Denmark's largest city and one of Europe's great hubs of culture, design, eco-consciousness, and progressive politics, Copenhagen has an extremely well-organized and visible GLBT community. The city hosts the impressively attended and extensive Copenhagen Gay Pride in mid-August - the dates this year are August 16 to August 20, 2016.
Planning to visit Copenhagen by train? Here's the inside scoop on buying a Eurail Pass.
Copenhagen Gay Pride comprises a number of events held throughout the city. For the four main days of the celebration, the city center's City Hall Square (at Radhuspladsen and Stroget is transformed into Pride Square and hosts concerts, art exhibitions, vendors, and more. It's open from Wednesday through Saturday from 11 am until 11 pm. 
The biggest day of Copenhagen Pride is Saturday, August 20. At 1 pm, the Copenhagen Gay Pride Parade departs Frederiksberg Rådhusplads (town hall). Then throughout the afternoon, the Copenhagen Pride Show takes place.
Other major Pride events in Scandinavia include Oslo Gay Pride and Helsinki Gay Pride, both of which take place in June, and Stockholm Gay Pride, which is held in late July.
Copenhagen Gay Resources
Note that Copenhagen's scores of gay-popular bars, restaurants, hotels, and shops in the area have more going on than usual during Pride week. Check online resources about the Copenhagen gay scene, such as the Patroc.com Gay Guide to Copenhagen. Also take a look at the excellent gay visitor site produced by the city's official tourism organization, Visit Copenhagen.

The Grand Tour of Copenhagen covers all the major sights of the Danish capital. Traveling in a comfortable bus on this tour, you visit Amalienborg Palace (the winter residence of the Danish Royal Family), the Little Mermaid in the harbor, and much more.
The tour departs daily year-round from City Hall Square (in front of the Palace Hotel). 
Listen to old tales of Shakespeare at Elsinore Castle, see Queen Margrethe's summer castle Fredensborg and bring your camera to photograph the beautiful nature of the Danish Riviera. This is one of the best guided tours in Denmark and a great value for the price. Departs daily in summer, 3 times weekly in winter.
You will see a lot of typical, idyllic Denmark on this tour, which includes a bus trip and a cruise along the historical harbor. One of the best short guided tours ever, this tour operates May through September (at least!). It concludes in the very heart of Copenhagen at Gammel Strand.
What a unique way to see Copenhagen. This guided tour "guides" visitors to each attraction in Copenhagen. You can hop on and off as many times as you want, on this fun-to-ride open-top double-decker bus! Each of the three routes offered takes about an hour. The Hop On Hop Off ticket is valid for 24 hours from first use, for all routes and as many rides to sights as you want to see.
The Copenhagen Card can serve visitors nicely as a low-cost tour guide: it includes a comprehensive guide of Copenhagen and gives travelers free local transportation, free admission to sights and attractions (for example, more than 60 museums are free!), and many other traveler-related discounts. Free transportation includes getting to and from the airport and discounts on car rental. 
If you are planning a trip to Copenhagen, you'll need transportation to your hotel and back to the airport after your visit unless you are visiting someone there who can provide transportation. You can take a cab, but it's usually a cheaper option to hop onto an airport shuttle. (As of August 2018, neither Uber nor Lyft was operating in Copenhagen.) Also, some Copenhagen hotels provide free shuttle service to and from the airport. Ask your hotel if that's available when you book your reservation.
You can also use a reliable, private transfer service so you don't have to wait for any other travelers and can avoid delays. An English-speaking driver picks you up (waiting for you at the airport or at your hotel) around the clock. 
Shuttle Direct transfers travelers between Copenhagen and Copenhagen Airport. You can book it for one-way in either direction or round trip for your return to the airport. If you're going from the airport to Copenhagen, the shuttle will take you directly to your hotel. You can either book a shuttle in a mini-bus that will include other passengers and will pick you up at a designated location or a private transfer that provides door-to-door service for your group exclusively.
A luxury airport transfer service is also available in Copenhagen, provided by companies such as MyDriver and World Airport Transfer. Prices are higher since the service is aimed at business travelers and luxury travelers. These services provide both minibusses and private cars.
When booking one of these private airport shuttle services, provide your flight details and hotel information for your visit to Copenhagen once you have the information available. This will ensure that the shuttle driver knows exactly when and where to pick you up.
If you don't want to take the shuttle, here are some other ways to get from the airport to Copenhagen:

Known for its design scene, culture, and first-class gastronomy, Copenhagen isn’t exactly a cheap destination. But don't let the capital of Denmark's high price tag deter you from visiting — the city has plenty of budget accommodations to choose from, so you can keep your kroner for all the rest of the experiences you’ll be having. Just because these hotels can be booked for less (mostly under 100 euro a night) doesn't mean you'll be staying in a hovel, either. Copenhagen's budget stays are really quite good if you just put a little time into researching. And guess what? We've done just that. Read on for our top picks, from a wallet-friendly downtown spot to surprisingly chic hostel.
Courtesy of Hotel Kong Arthur
No, that’s not a typo: Kong means “king” in Danish, and for a budget property, this 155-room hotel will make you feel like one. This old residence — once the home of 19th-century apprentices — is well-maintained and well-designed, with hygge touches like fireplaces, stacks of books, window sills piled with pillows, and a daily "Cozy Hour" where the hotel serves up "a little something" for guests. Remarkably, this hotel also has a great spa on site, as well as three restaurants that serve Italian, Spanish, and Japanese cuisine. The hotel’s rooms, available in both single and double formats, are clean and individually decorated, and those who book a spa package will get a spa room for bonus relaxation. If you’re traveling with your family, the double superior rooms can accommodate two extra beds for little heads. Guests can also join in on the hotel's running club (with free access to the spa facilities after) and get on the guest list for live music at a nearby jazz club. 
Courtesy of 66 Guldsmeden
Located on the main street of Copenhagen’s trendy Vesterbro neighborhood, this hotel — part of the same group as the Axel Guldsmeden — pulls out all the stops for parents and kids. Staff is lovely and very welcoming of children, and pets, for that matter, which starts a stay off right. Guest units are simple but lovely, with dark wood and art made by the owner’s father-in-law. The hotel is close to transit with a bus station one minute away, as well close proximity to attractions like Tivoli Gardens, which is about a 15-minute walk from the hotel. Back in the neighborhood, there’s plenty of parks, art galleries, and local eateries to discover. Speaking of food, breakfast isn’t free, but the on-site restaurant is ultra-cozy on a winter day with heated balconies and a fireplace. We recommend asking for a room facing the courtyard or in the annex for a quieter stay. 
Courtesy of Ibsens Hotel
Aside from a great nightly rate, this three-star hotel also adheres to admirable eco-friendly practices, making it a feel-good stay for not only your wallet but the environment as well. Guests love the staff who are efficient and friendly, and the location is great, too as it’s just a five-minute walk to the metro, from which it takes 15 minutes to get to the airport. The trendy Noerrebro neighborhood is also within walking distance, and the Nansensgade area next to the hotel has cute local shops and cafes, as well as a monthly flea market. Rooms are well-decorated for the price point, with stylish pops of color and modern furnishings. Do know, however, that the bathrooms are actually designed as wet rooms, so don’t be surprised if things get damp. Breakfast isn’t included, but it’s a good spread and everything’s organic (one child in each family can eat free as well) if you opt to pay for it out of pocket. 
Courtesy of Steel House Copenhagen
Let's get one thing straight: a hostel can be just as nice as a hotel — and this hostel, run by a hotel group, proves it with an easygoing vibe and a whole mix of guests, including families and older adults. If you haven’t stayed in a hostel before, prepare for this one to shake the lodgings' less-than-flattering stereotype from your mind. Steel House Copenhagen is stylish and fun with great staff who are extraordinarily helpful and amenities like foosball and pool tables. Dorms are simple but very clean, with an ensuite toilet and shower, bunk beds, and private lockers. Private rooms are also available for travelers who want to maintain their space. Surprisingly, Steel House also has an onsite gym and pool, though there is a separate fee to use them. We love the USB charging ports scattered throughout, which helps eliminate the need for adapters if you’re trying to travel light.
Courtesy of Axel Guldsmeden
Stylish and modern, the Axel Guldsmeden is a romantic retreat that’s also quite centrally located in town. Rooms are done in a sexy, modern Balinese style, with gorgeous woods and four-poster beds in each of its 202 rooms. If you want to splash out on a higher-end (but still budget) room, there are four penthouse suites complete with private rooftop terraces and hot tubs. There’s also a spa on site, as well a great restaurant, Cafe du Nord, that won't run you much more than city restaurants. Guests also rave about the staff: Everyone is incredibly friendly and helpful with recommendations and advice. Interestingly enough, Axel Guldsmeden is the “test” hotel for new concepts within the larger Guldsmeden chain, so be sure to ask if there’s anything fun going on when you check in. 
Courtesy of Hotel Windsor
Located within walking distance of Copenhagen’s major attractions — the Tivoli Gardens, Nyhavn, and more — Hotel Windsor boasts a wonderful downtown location just a one-minute walk from the Norreport metro station. Rooms are simple and unfussy (you won’t stay here for the design) but are bigger than the pictures make them look and are really clean. There’s a shared kitchen available for use, too, so you can save a bit of money by preparing a picnic lunch, or having a late dinner when you get back (there’s a market close by with a great selection of produce). Breakfast is conveniently included in the room rate, and it’s served at a sister hotel that’s a couple minutes’ walk away. Keep in mind that toilets and showers are shared at this hotel. That said, communal bathrooms are the norm at budget stays in Europe — especially when it comes to older hotels. 
Courtesy of Hotel Nebo
If you’re getting into town late or leaving the city early, you’ll want a hotel that’s not too much of a schlep from the train station or airport, and Hotel Nebo is just that. The hotel has 87 rooms and, though its furnishings are a bit dated, it’s well-suited for one night’s sleep. Both the hotel and train station are centrally located, so if you have a few hours to explore, you can easily reach key attractions by foot. If you’re traveling by air, it’s also just 12 minutes from the airport to the front desk. Travelers like the variety of room sizes available, with everything from single rooms with shared bathrooms up to quadruple rooms and apartments for larger groups traveling together. Breakfast is simple but free and conveniently begins at 6:30 a.m. for those with morning departures. 
Courtesy of Cabinn City Hotel
If you’re traveling on your own, Cabinn City Hotel is one of the few spots in Copenhagen where it isn’t too painful to not have a partner splitting the bill. Guests say you get what you pay for: Compact rooms that come with a private bathroom (just know in advance it’s wet-room style, so the floor might get splashed), and a really basic breakfast — though rooms also have kettles, which is a nice touch. The design actually plays into the smaller room size quite well. Each unit is designed to look like a cabin on a boat (hence the name of the place, too). Overall, it’s a cheap place to crash, and its downtown location will get you where you need to go in the morning. Cabinn City Hotel is just a 5-minute walk from the central station and close to Tivoli Gardens and the main shopping street. 
Courtesy of Bed & Breakfast Copenhagen
Located just outside the city center but with a metro stop about an eight-minute walk from the property, Bed & Breakfast Copenhagen is a great choice for travelers seeking a more close-knit stay in Denmark’s capital. With great value for money, this bed and breakfast offers large, scrupulously clean rooms, some with king beds. As fitting for a bed and breakfast, the owners are incredibly hospitable and take time to explain top sights and attractions to guests checking in. Travelers on a budget find the kitchenette super-convenient for packing lunches ahead of a day out in the city. Nearby, there’s a beach area, and the B&B's surrounds are home to creative types like artists, who have moved into the old warehouses in the neighborhood. Just be aware that rooms tend to get booked early (many guests stay long term), so plan ahead if you’re looking to stay here.
