Thirsty in Düsseldorf? The city is famous for its copper-colored, top-fermented Altbier, and what’s a better place to enjoy your Alt than in a traditional gastropub? Here are some of the best gastro pubs and restaurants in Düsseldorf’s Altstadt (Old Town), all of them brewing their own beer on the premises.
The translation of "Old Beer" might not sound that tasty, but this quintessential Dusseldorf beer is practically a tour stop when you're in town. Its name actually comes from it being top-fermented, a traditional style of brewing. It has a distinctively clean, crisp taste similar to a lager. If you are looking for it in the store in Germany, the Diebels brand is the most popular, but you should really try these small, local brewers for the best representation.​
Each of these traditional brewpubs also produces a small-batch of seasonal Sticke beer. Offered twice a year, in January and October, you can try this legendary strong beer with an alcohol content of 6%. Note that different breweries call it different things. For example, Schlüssel Brewery spells it Stike and Schumacher call it Latzenbier. 
You've been warned. Don't leave Dusseldorf without ordering a pint...or a few.
This gastropub, which translates to “little boat”, has been around for almost 400 years. It is one of the oldest restaurants in Düsseldorf and proud to have counted Napoleon among its guests. There is still a special “Napoleon’s Corner”.
The inside is rustic and cozy and in summer, there is also a Biergarten (beer garden). Specialties of the restaurant include homemade liver dumpling soup and herring "Rhineland style" with sour cream sauce, apples, onions, and potatoes. Follow the Rhineland motto,
Established in 1850, this rustic brewery and pub is set on Bolkerstrasse in the heart of Düsseldorf’s fußgängerzone (pedestrian zone). A fresh draft of the Original Schlüssel beer goes wonderfully with the restaurant’s local cuisine. Try the Butcher’s Plate with garlic sausage, Weißwurst, baked black pudding, bacon, sauerkraut, and mashed potatoes.
You can also take a guided tour of the Schlüssel brewery. This is a unique behind-the-scenes look at how top-fermented beer is created. Call 49 - (0)211 - 828 955 20 to schedule a tour (minimum size is 10 persons). The tour costs 10 euro per person and includes 2 glasses of Original Schlüssel beer.
Uerige has been brewing its beer since 1862. Besides Altbier, they also have fresh Weizenbier (wheat beer) on tap. On Mondays, Saturdays, and Sundays, the brewery offers a delicious limited menu. Try their famous pea soup or goulash.
Since 2014, the brewery offers an interactive media façade ‘Public Brewing’ which invites the public to brew their own beer.
Braumeister Heinrich Frankenheim started this brewery in 1873 and not much has changed over the centuries. Families and friends still gather here to enjoy the charming atmosphere, Altbier, and local specialties.
The brewery continues to evolve with their blend of Altbier and Cola merge (often called a Diesel) creating a new Düsseldorf drink, ​Frankenheim Blue.  
The restaurant and brewery of Zum Füchsen ("little fox") was opened in 1848 and is located on Ratingerstrasse. It is popular with locals with its Rhineland-style marinated pot roast with Rotkohl (red cabbage), potato dumplings and applesauce. If you are feeling a little bit full, try the local recommend Düsseldorf herb liqueur, Killepitsch.
Learn the lingo of beer making with the Braumeester (artisan brewer) or Zappes (keg master) before a Köbes (Rhineland beer hall waiter) brings you another round. 
Along with Füchschen, Uerige, and Schlüssel, Kürzer is one of the oldest gastropubs brewing within the Altstadt. Industrial, brick-lined walls enclose a bustling, modern interior. The beer may be traditional, but the vibe is not.
