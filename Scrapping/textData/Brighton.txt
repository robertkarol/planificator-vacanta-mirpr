Brighton is hip, colorful and, unusually for a seaside resort, urban. "London's beach", 60 miles from the capital, is a year-round day trip or short break destination with lots more to offer than its seafront. Shopping, dining, a hoot of a fantasy palace, a brilliant aquarium, great nightlife and theater, block after block of Regency houses - not to mention the most scenic pier in Britain - combine with a tolerant and breezy ambience to make Brighton a very cool place to visit and an even cooler place to stay awhile.

Every season has its pleasures and several major festivals - see below - draw large crowds to Brighton. If you're keen to try the rollercoaster and other thrill rides on Brighton pier, its best to visit May through October when there's less of a chance of blustery sea breezes. During the summer, Brighton beach and The Lanes can be very crowded at weekends.
The choice of accommodation ranges from small guest houses and B&Bs to trendy boutiques and New Age hostelries. Just make sure to get a good recommendation. Some of Brighton's B&B accommodations can be distinctly seedy and a number of its grand old dowager hotels have really seen better days.

There are dozens of fish and chip places and everyone has a favorite chippy. Avoid the stalls on Brighton Pier - unless you enjoy paying too much for far too little - and try one of these local favorites instead:
