Genoa, Italy's largest seaport city, has a fascinating aquarium, an interesting port, and a historic center said to be the largest medieval quarter in Europe, with a wealth of churches, palaces, and museums. Genoa's Rolli Palaces are on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
Genoa is on the northwest coast of Italy, the part known as the Italian Riviera, in the region of Liguria.
Genoa is a train hub and can be reached from Milan, Turin, La Spezia, Pisa, Rome and Nice, France. The two train stations, Principe and Brignole are both in central Genoa. Buses leave from Piazza della Vittoria. Ferries leave from the port for Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and Elba. There's also has a small airport, Cristoforo Colombo, with flights to other parts of Italy and Europe.
Genoa has a good local bus service. Local ferries go to towns along the Italian Riveria. From Piazza del Portello you can take the public elevator to go up the hill to Piazza Castello or the funiculare to go up to Chiesa di Sant'Anna where a good walking path descends from the church. The medieval part of the historic center is best visited on foot.

The historic regatta, one of Italy's most exciting, is held the first weekend in June every fourth year. Boatmen from the ancient maritime republics of Amalfi, Genova, Pisa, and Venezia compete (the festival rotates amongst these cities). There is a jazz festival in July. The statue "Christ of the Depths", underwater at the bay's entrance, is celebrated at the end of July with a Mass, the illumination of the reefs and a line of underwater torches to show the way to the statue.
Genoa is famous for pesto (basil, pine nuts, garlic, and parmigiano cheese) usually served over trenette or trofia pasta cooked with potatoes and green beans. Being a port city, you'll also find good seafood dishes such as the fish stew buridda. Cima alla Genovese is veal breast stuffed with organ meats, herbs, vegetables, and pine nuts, served cold.
The Genoa portion of the Italian Riviera has several interesting villages, ports, and resorts. Most can be reached by train, bus, or ferry from Genoa. Portofino, Rapallo, and Camogli are three of the most popular destinations. See our Italian Riviera Itinerary for more about where to go.
