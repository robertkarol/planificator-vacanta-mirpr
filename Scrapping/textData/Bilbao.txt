Bilbao airport is the main hub for airlines flying to the Basque Country (though there are now a few flights to San Sebastian airport). The airport is close to Bilbao city center, making connections easy, while there are also regular buses to take you straight to San Sebastian 
Which destination is better? Most visitors to the Basque Country spend more time in San Sebastian, due to the beach and pintxos (tapas) culture. Bilbao has pintxos too, but they in most bars they are only served cold. However, Bilbao is better for culture, as the Guggenheim museum is here.
There is a well-established bus transfer service from Bilbao airport to the city center which runs throughout the day and is very cheap. The service is run by Bizkaibus and starts early in the morning, in time for the first plane of the day. Many websites say the service starts at 6am but, in fact, there are buses earlier to coincide with the early Vueling flights.
